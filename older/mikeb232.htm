            <td valign="top"><tt>Long time again, loves. Wake up lately after six, seven hours and begin the hustle as
                the tea water starts. Compounded lately by insomnia. Growing into the legendary family fochmazel, maybe.
                <p>Ironically, due to a software glitch, a reminder box pops up on the computer every five minutes that
                  says &quot;frustration&quot; and &quot;impatience&quot;. Long story. Desktop looks like a losing game
                  of space-invaders.</p>
                <p>It's funny. We're selling our asses to all these college bookers (some of whom may even be reading
                  this), and so many of these places are baught and paid for by the good-god-damn-lord. Saw this speaker
                  the other day. An Orthodox Jew, from Brooklyn, whose people are all about God told us we are to be a
                  people without a country until there's angel's playing trumpets in the sky and shit, and that the
                  whole state of Isreal is blasphemous and founded by non-religious pigs and shit, and that Zionism is
                  against the Torah. And it seemed pretty cool and all peace and love 'till Rivka pointed out that he
                  was also saying &quot;we're the only real Jews&quot;, and it's more of the same bullshit, probably
                  mainly trying to convert people to their trip (who buys your food anyway?). &quot;Thank you God, for
                  not making me a woman&quot;, they pray.</p>
                <p>Thank you goddess, for giving me some female energy.</p>
                <p>Tried to stick the cock in it's own ass last night. Tight little hole, as close associates can surely
                  attest.</p>
                <p>Far as the live gigs go, just make sure you carry everything you need, 'cause someone somewhere is
                  gonna be missing one of the key ingredients and it's up to you to make it happen.</p>
                <p>Rather be a white kid who wishes they was black, or a black who wishes they was funky?</p>
                <p>Know this book, Herculine Barbin? Memoirs of a 19th century hermaphrodite. It's just not black and
                  white. Never has been.</p>
                <p>Headin' ta N'Orleans this weekend, which is really tomorrow night, which is really later today.
                  Definitely be repenting by Tuesday, which is Marz's day. Hopefully the nic won't sink her grubby,
                  slimy, sexy funkernails into these sore lungs again. Last stint was such sweet aching.</p>
