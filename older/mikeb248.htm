                    <td>Writing from a Motel 6 in Arcata, California. Decided against staying at Salmon House, where we
                      might be plaing tomorrow. A cold, moist, dusty, musty room in the &quot;main house&quot; with a
                      filthy old couch, complete with a guy sleeping in his overcoat. Ain't got the blankets for that.
                      Fuckit. Maybe we are yuppies.
                      <p>Got a call from Zef tonight with hopes that we are &quot;playing an awesome gig and saving
                        someone's life.&quot; There's an ad on the tv for a government website, recommending a family
                        plan in case of terrorist attack.</p>
                      <p>There seems to be some connection between these sexual and emotional blocks. Like a figure 8
                        tied up between the heart and loins. Doug VanderHoof was saying the French artists Jean Cocteau
                        would strip down at a party, lay on the floor and get and erection and cum without touching
                        himself. There's all these different stimuli can lead to a good cry, a firm erection. Some
                        mental, some emotional, some physical. Where and how do they combine and separate? To be able to
                        cry at will. Rock hard erection or wet vagina merely with a directed mind. And the funny thing
                        is these are probably minor by-products of being spiritually conscious.</p>
                      <p>Our new friend, Jean of Arc in Detroit inspired us with tales of home-made biodiesel, living
                        off the grid, and a cat psychic that found her on MySpace right in the middle of one of her cats
                        having a potentially life threatening health problem, ended up getting completely cleared up
                        with herbal remedies, according to the cat psychics diagnosis. Apparently the cat psychic lady
                        bases her diagnosees on photos of peoples cats and she's best friends with TV personality the
                        Dog Wisperer.</p>
                      <p>Decided we're gonna get pregnant next winter. Lifestyle now is against all sensibility, so why
                        not add children. So what that we're poor. An opportinuty for more faith. Life flying by anyway.
                        The realization of the totality of failure in life, and how little one actually suffers for it
                        can be a source comfort, and even lucidity.</p>

                      <p>Armadillo. Arm a psycho. Armageddon.</p>
