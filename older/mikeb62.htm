            <P>The final day of the festival of Megalesia, the great Mother.
            <P> Havn't eaten vagina in two weeks or so. Feels it. Decided not to cum today, semen retention
              sends that energy through the pineal gland or something. Sometimes after masturbation, it seems
              like a waste of energy. Sexual energy is one of our strongest, we can direct it, concentrate it toward
              spiritual
              and material goals.
            <P>Set hearts a-flame. Maybe not new, but something different.
              What's the difference 'tween <B>will power</B> and <B>discipline</B>?

              Write this shit to keep from watching Seinfeld.
            <P>Eating rat poison we spit in the face
              of the creator, except when it's fun.
            <P>Right/left, wrong, good, evil/bad, dark, light/heavy, god, devil/satan/lucifer/serpent.
              Serpent gave Eve head. Adam was bored.
            <P>Sugar addicted one god scaredycats think the ego is the soul. Spending miserable lifetimes at the mercy
              of the dark self.
            <P>MIGHT BE YOU NEED TO LOOSE YOUR SOUL TO FIND IT.
            <P>Shit Fuck Cocksucker Motherfucker Cunt Drawers you smell my stains and get horny.
