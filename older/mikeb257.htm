                      <p>So typical. One of the bright points of the &quot;historic&quot; street names, has been that
                        one is Peggy Stewart Way. Awesome. A woman. Great. Upon further research, unless they are
                        veering off into B-Movie stars of the 1930's, Peggy Stewart is the name of a ship that was
                        burned in the 1700's, having something to do with taxation, in an event that came to be known as
                        the Annapolis Tea Party. So much for feminism.</p>
                      <p>Taking long walks around the &quot;woods&quot; here with Rags, and Rinah in the baby pack; we
                        have this awesome papoose coat, she rides around in. Walking through these &quot;woods&quot; is
                        like the hiking version of eating the decorative parsley off your dinner plate in a restaurant.
                        You can only go like a city block in just about any direction before finding a condo or a
                        highway, but if you're slick, you can actually stay in the trees for about a mile.</p>
