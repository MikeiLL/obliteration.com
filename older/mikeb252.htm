                    <td>Smell of rubber. Firestone tire shop. Oil change and tire rotation. Probably not whatever else

                      <p>Wakest show of the tour was in Phoenix. No surprise there. Last minute thing. Guerilla-style
                        deal at a laundromat after the manager went home. Noone showed. Just the opening band, 1/2 of
                        whom left right after they played, the promoter and his roommate. We sat on the washing machines
                        and sang a few songs. Our friend from the other act was getting ready for the <a
                          href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUDD15SsoIk" target="_blank">demolition derby</a> next
                        day.</p>
                      <p>Pregnancy is coming along well, far as we can tell. There's an unidentified lump in her groin,
                        but after research, questioning and intuition, we will see what happens. The one surgeon we saw
                        thinks it's almost definitely not a cancerous tumor or a hernia. She recommends we just have it
                        removed. To a hammer every problem is a nail. All the midwives are on our side.</p>
                      <p>Ran into a guru maintaining the landscape at a state park at Mt. Shasta, CA. One of the most
                        spiritual places, apparently. According to hom more powerful than the Himmalayas or the big ones
                        in Brazil. Gave us a book list that included <u>The I Am Discourses</u> released by St. Germain
                        Press. There are more advanced versions of me, he said, whom you'll meet when you're ready. Once
                        you get beyond the music. He said then Stephen Gasken used to speak in San Francisco in the
                        Sixties (Rivka recognized his name 'cause he's the husband of the renowned midwife-author Ina
                        Mae Gasken) the walls would turn to liquid gold. Have you ever seen anyone do that?</p>
                      <p>Rivka goes, &quot;not that I know of, but maybe I wasn't looking at the walls&quot;.</p>
                      <p>Apparently Elvis and the Beatles were really high, but their music was satanic 'cause they
                        wanted the boys to think they were cool and the girls to sleep with 'em. Everything has an
                        opposite. Spell LIVE backwards and you get EVIL. Stop rendering my words. Hear them before you
                        create your own version of them. The water there is awesome. Some wonderful people danced to our
                        music and put us up.</p>
                      <p>With pregnancy Rivka's bra size has gone from an A being loose to a C being tight. Fun. The
                        kid's dancing in her belly a lot. Of course her sexual appetite is as fickle as her nutritional
                        appetite.</p>
                      <p>We're staying with Truckstop Honeymoon which is awesome. They're 7 months pregnant with their
                        third kid. Might cancel the rest of this tour 'cause it's 2 days off, then 1 show in smokey-ass
                        Joplin (where we sleep in chaos), then another show-less day and last show is close enough to
                        home we could just do it as a one-off.</p>
                      <p>The musical we're working on seems to be developing well. Only a few pieces left before we're
                        ready to staple the pattern together, I think. We're also s'posed to sing a chorus on a Scream
                        Club track which will be fun. They're great peops.</p>
                      <p>Many of our friends are touring europe and when will it be our turn? Soon, I think. Listening
                        to National Public Radio a lot. The Coca-Cola of community radio.</p>
