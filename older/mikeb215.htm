                Yea. Jesus Christ, son of God. See - see the links on the right of the page? If there's not too many bad
                words, they come up and what links come depends somewhat on what words are on the page. So if it's Jesus
                Christ, son of God, intermixed with say, second hand firearms, the links on the right side of the page
                will tell us something about who is spending what money on advertising with the link-putter.<br>
                <br>
                We must say second hand hand guns, no, second hand firearms along WITH Jesus Christ, Son of God a few
                times within out discussion, as you are, or rather between the click-clack, clucking back and forth and
                learning about who wants to pay what for which Jesus gun Fire God Son of Second Hand Christ or what
                not.<br>
                <br>
                Jesus Christ, son of God with a second hand firearm, or rather used gun, coming in wilding to the
                temple. Didn't have no wife and kids to worry about. He's click-clack, clucking about with trigger
                finger going off like a strobe light. Shootin' out the ceiling.<br>
                <br>
                Rabbi's like, &quot;Jesus Christ, son of God.&quot; Reaches for his own second hand firearm, happens to
                be an automatic, M-16, fires it into the ceiling; rat-a-tat-a-tat-tat-tat-tating and click-clack
                switching back and forth.<br>
                <br>
                Jesus's like, &quot;Money, money money, money, mother-f-cker. Is that all you people care
                about?&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Rest is up to Puntious Pilot, spelled correctly, of course.<br>
                <br>
                Interesting stuff, this web.
