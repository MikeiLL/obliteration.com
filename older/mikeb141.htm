My man who wanted to invest in putting my records out is in the nut house again. Isn't it ironic. Wouldn't mind going there for a while myself. Seems like everyone I know could use it.<BR>
Distress, depression and unemployment are rampant around here since the September 11th incident. These ones just got fired, this one swallowed a bottle of pills, these 10 are on their way to a funeral, wake or memorial service. Going out of business.<BR>
Never write in this  journal anymore 'cause I have a girlfriend now and she needs her goddam TIME, and I'm supposed to act like a goddam HUMAN, and we're supposed to life in a HOME instead of a flea bitten cell housing the tools of poverty and struggle; art. Ha.<BR>
And I'm so negative and fucking cynical and I don't realize that politicians are people too, just trying to do what they can just like me or you. I'm an outcast and a nut 'cause I believe that property is theft and New York (and Hollywood) is Babylon, and that the world might not be any more chaotic without laws and cops and hierarchy.<BR>
But as my main man Latch says (from his post on Jim D's couch), "Waddo-Eye-No?".<P>
So it's 6 in the morning, mosquitoes and snot forced me from sleep and these pre-arthritic fingers are getting dusty off this old Mac-top. My friends are getting day jobs, siblings buying houses and having babies and my homeboys are smoking pot (if they can get it - military state around here), stuffing their noses or getting committed. My heroes are getting killed fighting against the global capital empire which I'm too simple-minded and idealistic to understand or explain, but just have a feeling against.<BR>
And even though yesterday was my birthday and I'm WAY the fuck past twenty-one, it's so hard to act like the emperor's wearing clothes and society is not so bad, and there's no such thing as "the rich" and no-one conspires agains the poor and third world and bla bla fucking bla to the mother-fucking shit fuck scum piss rot.<P>
Let's see if we can dial on up and put this bad boy on the web. And if anyone ever looks at this web-diary anymore hopefully you'll laugh (you know I love you), and I'll go to church in a few hours and sing "Ave Mareeeeeeeiiiiaaah" at some stragers wedding for fifty bucks and enjoy another day of middle class existence.<BR>
Have a great night.</TD></TR></TABLE>
