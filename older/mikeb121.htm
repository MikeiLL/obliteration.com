Things feeling really good lately. Geting lots of full page articles in local press. Been making it a point to jump in as many lakes, streams, ponds and creeks as possible during the road trips.<P>
It's so great to whip off all my clothes under a little overpass or at the edge of a dam (the douglass dam yesterday) and cool off, floating in a lake or just sitting in an icy creek.<P>
Met this amazing young artist named Erin Hunt in Ashville who came to Statesville with me, 'cause she's friends with <A Href="http://www.abereid.com">Abe Reid</A> too. The gig there was a blast. Abe in his drummer backed me up for an hour or two in this sports bar, there were maybe 15 people in the place. We had a blast.<P>
The Erin took me to where she lives. It's a community in the Black Mountain area outside of Ashville. All these, well you might cal them hippies. They have an organic farm, and there's all these people building houses from scratch and farming and shit. Amazing.<P>
Well, I'm headed to Athens, GA today with Sam Boswell who's putting together the <A Href="http://murderman.artshost.com">Murderpalooza</A> festival. He hooked me up last night with this really cool dude <A href="http://rus13.artshost.com">Russ Harper</A>, who ruins a spoken word scene around here. There was a guy there who's making a movie called <A href="http://www.vampirebitches.com">Vampire Bitches</A> and wants to use some of my song Walking Dead in it. Supposedly Penthouse is gonna use that song in this video they're doing called The Harlots of Hell.<P>
Played the <A Href="http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/groundzerosc/main.html">Ground Zero</A> in Saprtanburg two nights ago with a cool instrumental band called the Pygmies. I love the people there. Mick was telling al these wild stories about shit that goes on around there. We were hangin' till four in the morning. This erotic poet was at the gig. She bought Antifolk Road Manual and sent me this poem today:

LYRICAL MAN<BR><BR>

©greeneyedlady2k_2000<BR>
August 2000<BR><BR>

A lyrical man with incredible eyes,<BR>
I read his pain; listened to his 'noise'.<BR>
His fear before us,<BR>
As he played his heart.<BR>
The lights glow soft, dim, dimmer,<BR>
And a slice of a silhouette sings.<BR>
Words of life and doubt,<BR>
Being thrown at us without loss of self.<BR>
A lyrical man of musical essence,<BR>
Notes flowed from his veins.<BR>
Still restless he follows his muse.<BR>
Pay no attention to phoniness,<BR>
Sing it out - sing for your life.<BR>
Take us with you,<BR>
Use us to amplify.<BR>
Help is only a lifetime away.<BR>
A lyrical man with a delicious soul,<BR>
Lay it out onto paper.<BR>
Tear out our hearts,<BR>
And have them for dinner.<BR>
Spit your soul-felt prose in our faces.<BR>
Cleanse it all away,<BR>
Scrub the enemy from your thoughts.<BR>
Nothing will ever change him,<BR>
He will always be.<BR>
Save us all from mundane life's<BR>
Losing banality.<BR>
Sing to us - give it your best and only shot.<BR>
And we will remember,<BR>
A lyrical man with an impassioned heart.<BR>
