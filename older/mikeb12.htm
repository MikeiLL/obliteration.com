        <P> Good weather to sleep through the afternoon. Stay up all nite.
          Sex is real wet this time of year. I remember this woman, Tracy from New Orleans
          who ejaculated when she came. I thought she was pissing at first. Amazing. Her brother was a bisexual cook
          who is supposedly involved in porno movies now.</P>
        <P> There should be a word for masterbating in front of the computer. Some times I do it while I'm waiting for
          a file to download, or some kind of application to be completed. What a fucking world we live in. Look out for
          the internet police. </P>
        <p> Please come see <A Href="http://www.obliteration.com/o_site/noise/illness/shows.htm"
