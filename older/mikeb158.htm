Almost got arrested last night while wheat-pasting fliers for the CBGBs show next Saturday. By a Port Authority cop non-the-less. They're the worst. Ever since I was a kid, nothin' better to do than detain your ass. This guy saw us putting a poster up and was actually somewhat cool about it. "You wanna take that down or you wanna go ta jail? Got any more up around here? Well, if I see anymore, I took down your license and you'll be hearing from me."<P>
Hopefully we won't be hearing from him. Every time I do that shit I hope it's the last time. Guerilla marketing. Spending the night in jail ain't no fun proposition, yo. Good place to start smoking again.<P>
Mad Happy CDs are flying out of the stores like lead butterflies. Ha ha. That's what you get for not joining a style. Hey, we didn't make the world.<P>
We did end up going to Lexington with some money from the record company. Forteen hundred miles there and back in three days. Played a good set at a wak show. There was a cool band playing which was like, one of those hip-hop/jam bands. Chuck D style rapping. Very political. Seemed cool. What were they called...? Hopefully we'l find 'em again.<P>
