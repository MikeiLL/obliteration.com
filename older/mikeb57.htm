<P>A true master does not create desciples, but masters.
<P>This is based on a story told by the Sufi mystic, Rumi, as told to me by the poet <A HREF="http://www.s-sense.com">Pablo Rosenblueth</A>.
<UL>
<LI>A seeker knocks on gods door.
<LI>God says 'who is it?'
<LI>Me
<LI>Go AWAY!
</UL>
The seeker sulks for a while and studies the universe for some years, then returns to gods door.
<UL><LI> Knock Knock
<LI>Who is it?
<LI>Me.
<LI> GO AWAY
</UL>
The seeker is very dispondent, and spends years in solitude. Finally he has a revalation. He has seen many things, and seen people born and die, grow and fall in and out of love. After a long journey he comes again to the door of god.
<UL><LI>Knock Knock 
<LI>Who is it?
<LI> It's You

He is invited in.
