                    <td>Funny how this &quot;diary&quot; seems to have taken the same route as school work used to,
                      starting out strong and waning as time went on. Kind of depressing. Maybe the cycle will come
                      around again. It's so interesting writing into a near-black hole. Knowing that this entry will be
                      available to much of the world, but may never actually be seen by anyone.
                      <p>Staying with Rivka's sister in Annapolis, MD, where she works for the US government; a job
                        she's not allowed to describe. We'll be here for two months to help as her first baby is born.
                        Single mother. Walking around the sprawling development she lives in daily, with Rinah, at 5
                        months old, in the Ergo baby-pack and Rags running around sniffing and pissing on shit. Today,
                        Sunday afternoon and gorgeous, although there are many cars parked, noone is out, and even the
                        houses seem lifeless. All the cars look new.</p>
                      <p>The development is in the neo-colonial style, with street names like Burton's Cove Way, Puritan
                        Way, John Carrol Way and others named after governors and people who may have come off the
                        Mayflower. Wonder if an ad agency developed them. The buildings are of three styles; single
                        family (town house?), two family and apartment building. All of each are nearly identical,
                        excepting the siding, which is either a shade of brick between white and red, vinyl betweeen
                        gray and white, or a combination. Most of the houses have bay windows and fake shutters in
                        either forrest green or dark red. There are two &quot;nature walks&quot; paved with asphalt that
                        wind behind the rows of houses, yesterday there was a family of deer very close to one of them.
                        The young deer actually jumped over it's mom to put her between it and the human.</p>
                      <p>In the apartment, cable TV has been playing movies for 10 hours a day, which can be draining.
                        <a href="http://www.chomsky.info" target="_blank">Noam Chomsky</a> talks about how in the
                        advertising agencies, the commercials are described as the content, and that which is between
                        them, the filler. It's a fact that minute per minute, the ads cost more. Some people are more
                        capable than others of ignoring a telivision which is just on for ambiance. The trees are half
                        evergreens, and ones which have lost their leaves for the winter. The ferns on the forrest floor
                        are still green. There was a thick layer of snow on the ground when we arrived a few days ago,
                        surrounded by dirty piles, bulldozed out of the parking lots or shoveled from the walkways. The
                        trash hasn't been picked up in many days, possibly due to weather, and is surrounding and heaped
                        over the garbage cans in the wood-fenced off areas where people drop off their little packages
                        of kitchen garbage.</p>
                      <p>Picked up an un-opened 5 pound burlap sack of Himalayan basmati rice, with a best if used by
                        date of March of last year. Probably still good, right? But we'll see what the ladies think.</p>
                      <p>Been warm and drizzly the last couple of days with the snow dissapating, steam rising into the
                        fog. Beautiful. The thudding sound of melting snow piles falling from the trees and he drip of
                        water falling through the gutters.</p>
                      <p>Our hearts have, aside from their basic plumbing role, two sides to their metaphorical
                        existence. There is the heart that desires, and the heart that empathizes. The active and the
                        receptive. The heart that desires is the house of our ambition as well as our envy, and the
                        heart that empathizes is the root of our sensitivity, as well as our fear. So while we wanna
                        listen to our heart, we want it to be a source of information, a translator from our deeper
                        self, and not our master. It's probably when we don't listen to it that it's more likely to be
                        our master.</p>
                      <p>Our guts, aside from being our sewage system, we describe as the source of our intuition, the
                        receptive aspect, and will, the active. So the intuitive aspect of the &quot;gut&quot;, our
                        center, feeds it's information to the receptive, empathetic heart, which contacts the self, the
                        witness, generating multiple desires, and we decide which to act upon, sending the message back
                        to the seat of power, our will, and guided by disciplin, manifest our desired reality.</p>
