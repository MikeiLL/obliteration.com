<table border="0" cellpadding="10"><tr><td valign="top"><tt>Reading some of the info in that link to Rocco Siffredi actually turned me off to his ass a bit. Power corrupts, prick. After some deeper thought; some of you read this as part of your study of humankind, and many, including a lot a great friends, with a deep respect. Thank you so much for that. It's wonderful to have an outlet that leads to a concrete place. You fuckin' rock. And if this provides some inspiration, some entertainment, some enlightenment or even just some escape, then that's the shit.<p>You people are definitely worth braving the cold fire of human life to be in touch with.</p>
								<p>Here is an email from Gina Paiano, came today on myspace. She's been working on a book about her days as a teenage...well...anyway, hopefully she'll put out her Camel, or American Spirit long enough to finish it someday 'cause it looks awesome so far.</p>
								<p>&quot;Desire is, after all, the cause of all suffering... <br>
									Be it desire for pleasure or for pain to end ... to undo what has <br>
									happened, or to design what is yet to be... to regain what is lost, or <br>
									to lose what is unpleasant, unsightly or unsavory... <br>
									A desire to have or have not, to do or undo, to remember or <br>
									forget...is a desire, all the same. <br>
									And as one desire, after the next, is realized... where is our repose? <br>
									For how long (indeed - if at all), do we bask in the warm glow of a <br>
									want fulfilled? <br>
									Can we linger, if only for a moment, in the blessed stillness of here <br>
									and now... that etherial niche between lack and pursuit... the <br>
									wickedly elusive animus of all endeavors, content? <br>
									Or are we condemned to trudge ever-forward, enslaved by our whims and <br>
									justified longings, harvesting and trampling each new rose in the very <br>
									same step, until our greatest desire is to desire no more? <br>
									<br>
									<br>
									And so, I wrestle with mine... <br>
									And lo, I rarely win.&quot; -GP</p>
