          We live where space is an impossible commodity. Someday everybody will know this life. It's too hot in here
          and it smells. That's the payoff for living with two young females. Could be worse.<BR>
          Had to leave the closing party of the last cool bar in town tonight. Too much failure reflecting my sorry
          position. I'm already drained from spending rent money to record my shit-ass music today. It's worse than
          shit, 'cause it doesn't even imply or leave room for what nature makes, and I ain't no bird.<BR>
          Realized walking home in the freezing air that there IS ne reason for it. Been through this before. Just an
          obsession. Unoriginal, not unique, not fearless, not stylized, not even sellable. Too bad Trent Reznor already
          uses the name Nothing for his record company.<BR>
          They say Nothing is the root of the universe. To know Nothing is to know all there is to know. I know too
          much.<BR>
          At an open mic tonight I thought, "I'll have kids and never let them find out I was a musician".<BR>
          No, but enough of the negative shit. I'm just unhappy 'cause I fear for the future; 40 more years of unpaid
          struggle. I think heroin addiction is more expensive than music. At least music keeps getting you high. So far
          anyway.<BR>
          <A Href="http://www.eclipse.net/~fitzgera/perry/prhome.htm" target="_newbrowser">Perry Robinson</A> and Zef
          Noi$e came in the studio today though and played some beautiful clarinet and violin on this song Magdeline.
          They rule.<BR>
          And you know what? This record is gonna rule. It might only rock a handfull of peoples world, but mine is one
          of 'em. Man, it's so great to be able to get high like this. I'm thirty-one years old (count 'em), been in
          this music game (for real) since eleven and am just learning how to sing. I can sing and it sounds good to me.
          Fuckin' great. I can go anywhere on this planet and entertain any crowd. And anyone that hangs with me long
          enough will be able to too. I can make love to someone and they enjoy it. I can hear music and I can hear
          people.<BR>
          What more could I ask? To hell with the so-called future. James Brown made it legal for yo' armpits to stink,
          and Mike iLL's gonna make it legal not to have style. That's right baby. Antifolk, antifuck, antifunk,
          antirap, antirock, antipunk. I'll even be antiGod and have the biggest revalation of them all...<BR>

          Keep you posted.</tt>
