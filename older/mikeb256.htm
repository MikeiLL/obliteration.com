                      <p>How does a girl get the name Honey, one might wonder. Imagine her ex-boyfriend's father,
                        sticking his head in the window of the apartment, meeting her for the first time. Wearing
                        nothing but a sheet she goes, "Hi, I'm Honey. From the bar." A classic story she loves to tell.
                        Her legal name is Chana; a Hebrew name, but the're's no english equilivent of the CH sound,
                        which is made by vibrating the back of the tongue against the roof of the mouth, similar to
                        pulling phlegm up from your throat, or more respectfully, a purring sound. Rivka explained it,
                        with instructions that it's like the sound a teenage american girl might make to exaggerate her
                        exasperation in an exhale. <br>But since most American's can't pronounce the Hebrew letter,
                        Chet, they just make and H sound, which would turn her name into Hah-nah (rhymes with wanna).
                        But since the Jews, at least in the Borrough Park, show affection by changing an Uh sound at the
                        end of a name to an Eeeh sound, like Rivka to Rivki or Chana to Chani, she ended up being called
                        Hah-nee, by typical Americans, which sounds like a nasal version of Honey. Rivka wanted her to
                        change her name to Devash, the Hebrew word for Honey, but now she simply offers Ana, to the
                        challenged.<br>
                        Honey was the name of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TrQxeNEPLo"
