        <FONT SIZE="+2">Played to empty rooms all weekend. Well, not empty, but lets just say there was loooots of elbow
          room. Maybe room for an elbow and a few small cars.<BR>
          The drummer from Southern Culture on the Skids was at Local 506 in Chapel Hill on Friday though, and
          wants to play with me, which is cool, 'cause his band is real popular. You know, rock stars and shit.
          He was comparing this stuff to Tom Waits and Nick Cave. Go on brother, I can dig it.<BR>
          Played with these boys from Big Ass Truck in Memphis last night. They backed me up for a whole set.
          That was cool as hel. Even got paid a bit, maybe make up for these past four shows.<P>
            Love the low clouds down here.<BR>
