            <td valign="top"><tt>Suck you in. All wealth. Come ye seeker of Porsche dealership, New York. Sucked in the
                Causabon to the Plan of the Diabolicals in <a href="http://www.2think.org/fp.shtml"
                  target="_newbrowser">Eco</a>'s <a href="http://plus.maths.org/issue9/xfile/"
                  target="_newbroswer">Foucault's Pendulum</a>. Come seeker of SUV, sports car, Rolex watch.</tt>
              <p><tt>&quot;Truth is brief (afterward it is all commentary).&quot;, Eco writes. &quot;What has taken
                  place in the real world was predicted in penny dreadfuls.&quot;; in relation to the juxtaposition of
                  Shakespear, Melville, Balzack (who's that?), Dostoyevsky's sensational fiction, Cabalistic symbolism
                  and the &quot;future&quot;.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>Pray to God, the new same for Satan (or is it the other way around?), as per Revalations. Open a <a
                    href="http://allnycars.com/porsche.html" target="_newbrowser">Porsche</a> dealership, Miami,
                  specializing in hundred thousand dollar exotic cars. Cater to wealthy Long Island housewives and
                  mid-life crisis lawyers. Wear Gucci and Rolex. Go to the gym. Drink mineral water. Live to a
                  thousand.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>Summon the Egyptian dieties, Ra, Isis, Osiris, Anubis. Do their dances. Dance to Kali and Shiva.
                  Eat nothing but air. Drink your own urine. </tt></p>
              <p><tt>Hail all Capricorn babies; part fish, part goat. Tail in the freezing ocean, hooves on the
                  mountaintop; seeing all.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>So you wealthy doctors beg to be initiated. Home from the Porsche Dealership, South of France with
                  a temporary lease on youth.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>By boy complains his wife is getting fat and doesn't want to fuck him. Not attracted to her anyway.
                  They all become the same beast after a while. That's what hand-cuffs, blindfolds, whip cream and
                  literature are for. Leave half an orange for <a href="http://www.yasminhernandez.com/yemayayochun.htm"
                    target="_newbrowser">Ochun</a>. Massage the womans feet and temples, maybe some scented oil, 'till
                  the first male diety rises like <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/shango.html"
                    target="_newbrowser">Shango</a>. She becomes maleable, wet. Gazes up and becomes Aprodite
                  again.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>The Rolexes, Porsche dealership, Gucci and pride fade like ink in a hot bath. Skin burns like
                  swimming North Atlantic waters in January. Life, Death, Rebirth. Click. Click. Click.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>Oh. Now I remember. Ohm. Deep breath. Mineral water, strait out the tap.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>A million blessings and a thousand orgasms to you all. Men, retain the white syrup. Send it up the
                  spine like a wound-up snake. Ride the pink Porsche made of pure light and pick up pieces of astral
                  booty. Fast. Faster. Faster. Fastest. Bang.</tt></p>
              <p><tt>We all winners in the eighteen gazillion mile relay. Track is infinity. Smile. Only nine zillion
                  laps to go.</tt></p>
