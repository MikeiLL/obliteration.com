                Last couple sucked, in Phoenix and LA. How it's s'pozta be. Playing for ghosts in a foreign town.</p>
                <P>Carry everything. Count on nothing, barely even electricity.
                <P>
                  Bullies everywhere, friendly and not. Somethings don't change. Can't show a moments weakness or they
                  know you suck. Confidence. Anger helps. Communicate with who else is on the stage. Don't forget.
                  Concentrate: the ears, the limbs, the eyes, the lips, the throat, the toung, stomach, hips, hands,
                  jaw.
                <P>
                  Promoters talkin' 'bout Beck and all these rock stars. Droping names on the greasy floor of the
                  Chinatown venue. Cool cat. Los Angeles, giant billboards and homeless people everywhere. Gutter to the
                  stars.
                <P>
                  Homeboy, Zack is playing with a huge heavy metal band now, drinkin' Tequila and gettin' blowjobs from
                  naked groupies on the bus every night. It's a job.
                <P>
                  Life's getting easier, but def not too easy. Far the fuck from it, mentally, yo. Just a matter of
                  forgetting fear and let go anxiety now, though. Will you be that homeless cat? If not this lifetime
                  another, so quit worrying. Love more.
                <P>
