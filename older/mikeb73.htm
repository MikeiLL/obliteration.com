            Last Wednesday there was a Solar Eclipse and what they call a Great Cross, where 4 planets (I think Pluto,
            Mars, Venus... not sure) make a giant cross. <P>
              So we got in the ill van at like 3:30 in the morning and drove down the shore.
              There were 12 of us; Me, Jimmy D, Erin (Betty Boops), Mr. Taps, David (with his accordion), Mikey Middles
              and Mary Roland (psychic), Ronda Jill, Mark the Shark (NyQuill Bass Player), Rivka, Lach, Rocky LaShea and
              Pervis.
            <P>
              We had conga, jimbe, acoustic guitar, accordion and a whole bunch of singers. We're totally stoned,
              singing... gonna get some sand in our toes. The funnyest was when I pulled into the state troupers
              headquarters to ask for directions. Taps, who has like 6 warrents was fuckin' pissing his pants. I didn't
              realise that's what it was 'till we were already in there. I'm like, tellin' this trouper about the
              eclipse and stuff... cause he's all "Don't you think it's a little early to be going to the beach?". It
              was funny.
            <P>
              Swimming naked in the warm ocean water (even though it was too cloudy to see the eclipse) was the bomb.
            <P>
              Thanks Mom.
