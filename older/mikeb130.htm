        Met this self-described dandy at a really cool spoken word event here in London last night; Express Excess.
        Heard someone talking to him about his web diary so I introduced myself. Turns out he has a band too. Here's a
        <A Href="http://www.fosca.com/dickon/index.html" target="_newbrowser">Link</A> to his site.<BR>
        Had stressed out dreams today and slept 'till 3:00 PM.<BR>
        My man Taps, one of the wilder loves of my life sent me these pictures from his moms new scanner. Check these
        freaks out...

      <TD>Nicole was his girlfriend for a while. Her band Dimension Network were influenced by Pink Floyd and Jane's
        Addiction. She rocked this totally revolutionary baby-talk vocal style, bringing all these stuffed dolls on
        stage and shit.<BR>
        Came out of the Jersey suburbs and was stunningly beautiful and sexy. Wish I could tell you more, but she might
        sue me. Use your imagination.</TD>

        Lance won't sue me 'cause he doesn't give a fuck. He's been a junkie since before Christ. Did 10 years for bank
        robbery after being on the FBI's most wanted for about five minutes. Lance taught my girlfriend to shoot up so
        she wouldn't hurt herself doing it wrong. He was there for me when another lover O.D.d and died in my arms while
        I slept.<BR>
        Gotta love people who are so hard-core they have nothing whatso-ever to hide - at least in certain areas.<BR>
        Doctors told Taps when Lance dies they're gonna do an autopsy not to see what killed him, but to see what kept
        him alive for so long. Once he shot up a syringe full of amonia and only felt dope-sick.

        Thanks for the picts Taps. You continue to rock my world.<P>
          Wanna give a shout out to Annelies Valkenaers and her family. Working folks in Belgium. They have this Celtic
          folk band and take care of me when I come there.<BR>
          Props also to my man Jared from Chemlab who turned me on to the Spoken word thing last night. <a

          Crazy love to Zef Noi$e and Kill Audio who are living at the Space Station in Newark and making a super-bad
          new record.<BR>
          Oh yea,that reminds me. Their neighborhood out there is pretty ill. Great deals on crack and heroin just
          around the corner. One night after dropping like $2000 worth of gear off at the place, Zef went back out to
          park the car and these two illers held a gun to his face and made him drive around the corner where they
          kicked him out of the car, took his $2.00 and proceeded to take the car.<BR>
          Guy gets in the driver seat and is like, "I can't drive stick, you drive".<BR>
          "I can't drive a stick motherfucker, I thought you could."<BR>
          Punchline is that they ended up leaving the car there 'cause neither of them could drive it.<BR>
          Now THAT shit is funny.<BR>
          Blessings to everyone who represented at the anti-inauguration in DC this past weekend in the icy rain. "Hail
          to the Theif".
