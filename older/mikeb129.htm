        Cool. We're still here. New Millenium. So-called millenium anyway.<BR>
        Been reading some shit <A Href="http://www.dragonflyrecords.co.uk" target="_newbrowser">Youth</A> lent me. He
        lent me two really amazing books. The first one I read is caled <U>Trance-formations</U> by the Authors of this
        really famous book called <U>Frogs into Princes</U>. It's transcriptions of lectures to a bunch of hipnotists in
        the 1970's, based on this German hipnotist named Milton Ericson.<BR>
        The basic idea seems to be to get a person into a "trance" state, where the conscious mind is disengaged, so
        that the unconscious mind can do it's various works unencombered by ego and rationalism and shit. The book
        discusses all these different ways to induce trance, and then various methods to guide the unconscious. Man, I'm
        tellin' you; this shit rocked my world. The coolest thing is Youth founded this dance music label Dragonfly
        which is like the first "hard-trance" label, and he's actually into hipnotism and shit.<BR>
        He was telling me about the scene in the beginning 10 years ago or so. Ten thousand people under the stars
        anywhere from Marocco to Thailand to Brasil, total underground scene, and it's still going on. Lots of exstacy
        and shit. That's a big part of it, but there's definitely some powerful magic going on here.<BR>
        He also lent me a book I'm reading now called <U>New View over Atlantis</U> by John Michell, and eccentric
        British guy who's currently honorary head of the Druids and also happens to be good friends with my sister
        Daphne who introduced me to him ecently. The book talks about the various sciences of math and measures whos
        knowledge can be discerned from many pre-historic stone sites like Stone-henge, the Egyptian and South-American
        Pyramids, in ancient Israeli, Maltese, Roman and Greek temples. There's something called the "sacred rod". A
        measurement equal to about 3.5 of our feet which is actually a near-exact fraction of the circumpherence of the
        Earth. John Michell says that the ancients had very advanced sciences and math, and knew the size of the planet
        and all this shit way long ago. Even Sir Issac Newton went to Egypt to take measurements of the pyramids when
        trying to figure the size of our planet.<BR>
        He's also talking about lay lines which can be seen defined by the placement of various ancient paths and
        temples, which he says come from a time when we people treated the Earth like a living being. Man. Too much to
        go into right now, but suffice to say this hard little mind is opening up a bit.<BR>
        Rivka's telling me she wants us to make somemoney so we can havekids in a few years. I wanna do that too. You
        wanna do that? Sucks you have to get a corporate job to be able to afford health benifits in this country. I
        heard she can get Israili citizenship 'cause she's Jewish. Maybe we'll go help occupy Israel.<BR>
        Listen. If you buy one CD this year, go to the CD store and track down "Elysian Fields". Friends of mine. This
        shit is amazing. The first CD is on Radioactive records, not sure about the new one, but you can order it from
        my main man Bruce at Downtown Music Gallery. The number's listed at the bottom of our <A
          href="http://www.obliteration.com/buy_stuff/index.html" target="_newbrowser">Buy Stuff </A> link.<BR>
        Gorgeous, underground and real.<BR>
