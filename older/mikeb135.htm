Met this kid Walter the other day at NY Head studios where Poor Old Souls are working on some of our new shit.
He was in this seminal hard-core band Guerilla Biscuts, and ent on to play with Youth of Today, Sick of it All and then form Quicksand. Real sweet guy.<BR>
Was supposed to take my woman out tonight, but I'm so stressed and depressed. Where do you go for $3 dollars?<BR>
