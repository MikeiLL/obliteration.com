                    Health Freedom to End in August 2005???<br>
                    <br>
                    Something is happening in virtual secrecy that may<br>
                    have an adverse affect on all of us.<br>
                    <br>
                    The CODEX ALIMENTARIUS (Food Code) is setting the<br>
                    supplement standards for the countries in the WTO,<br>
                    which includes the United States. The CODEX rules are<br>
                    intended to be enforced by the WTO and to override<br>
                    individual member nation laws. The U.S. President and<br>
                    Congress agreed to this take-over when the WTO Treaty<br>
                    was signed.<br>
                    <br>
                    CODEX drastically restricts vitamins, minerals, herbs<br>
                    and other supplements. CODEX met secretly in November,<br>
                    2004<br>
                    and finalized &quot;Step 8 (the final stage)&quot; to begin<br>
                    implementation in June 2005.<br>
                    <br>
                    Virtually nothing about it has been in the media. <br>
                    What the drug corporations have failed to do through<br>
                    Congress<br>
                    they may get by sneak attack through CODEX with the<br>
                    help of a silent media.<br>
                    <br>
                    The CODEX says, among other things:<br>
                    <br>
                    (1) No supplements can be sold for preventative or <br>
                    therapeutic use.<br>
                    <br>
                    (2} Any potency higher than RDA (minimal strength)<br>
                    is a drug requiring a prescription and must be<br>
                    produced by drug companies. Over 5000 safe items now<br>
                    in health stores will be banned, terminating health<br>
                    stores as we now<br>
                    know them.<br>
                    <br>
                    (3) CODEX regulations become binding internationally.<br>
                    <br>
                    (4) New supplements are banned unless given very<br>
                    expensive CODEX testing and approval.<br>
                    <br>
                    In Norway and Germany, where CODEX is now<br>
                    implemented, zinc tablets rose from $4 per bottle to<br>
                    $52, Echinacea rose from $14 to $153 and both are now<br>
                    available by prescription only. They are now called<br>
                    &quot;drugs&quot;. Vitamin C<br>
                    above 200 mg; niacin above 32 mg; vitamin B6 above<br>
                    4 mg are all banned. In addition, amino acids<br>
                    (arginine, lysine, carnitine, etc. ); essential fatty<br>
                    acids (omegas 3, 6, 9, etc.), or other essential<br>
                    supplements such as DHEA,<br>
                    CoQlO, MSM, beta-carotene, etc, are not allowed.<br>
                    <br>
                    The CODEX rules are not based on any real science or<br>
                    research. They are made by a few people meeting in<br>
                    secret . In 1993 the FDA and drug corporations tried<br>
                    to put all supplements under restriction and<br>
                    prescription. But over 4 million Americans told<br>
                    Congress and the President<br>
                    to protect their freedom of choice on health<br>
                    supplements. The DSHEA Law was passed in 1994, which<br>
                    protected our freedom. But this will be over ruled by<br>
                    CODEX and the World Health Organization.<br>
                    <br>
                    Is this real?<br>
                    With WTO secrecy, no media attention, confusion and<br>
                    uncertainty among supplement companies and public<br>
                    officials, and support by the FDA and harmaceutical<br>
                    lobby, uncertainty prevails. It appears, based on my<br>
                    limited understanding, that the US Congress has to<br>
                    pass legislation to require CODEX implementation in<br>
                    the United States<br>
                    before this can take effect. The August implementation<br>
                    is for the European Union. But, there is legislation<br>
                    in the US House and Senate to make this the law of our<br>
                    land as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    What Can We do?<br>
                    First, we need to be as well informed as possible,<br>
                    especially given the secrecy in which this is being<br>
                    handled.<br>
                    <br>
                    The following websites offer additional information:<br>

                    <br>
                    Second, we all need to contact our congressmen and<br>
                    senators to make sure that they are informed about<br>
                    what is happening and that we, the voters, don't want<br>
                    it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Oppose bills S.722 and H.R.3377. (These bills support<br>
                    the CODEX restrictions with US laws, changing the<br>
                    DSHEA law<br>
                    that we fought so hard for.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Express your wishes to the President, Senators and<br>
                    Representatives ASAP.<br>
                    <br>
                    (They got us into this!)<br>
                    <br>
                    How??<br>
                    You can find the contact information on your<br>
                    congressmen and representatives by going to this<br>
                    website and<br>
                    entering your zip code.<br>
                    <a href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home/"
                      target="_blank">http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home/</a><br>
                    <br>
                    I implore you NOT to support CODEX restrictions in the US, and to please send me any information you
                    can share on them.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am health-conscious 35 year old artist and feel these restrictions move away from giving
                    individuals and communities more control and access to natural health practices and toward more
                    chemicals, more ignorance and more corporate power.<br>
                    <br>
                    Thanks for your consideration. I know I speak for many people. Be well.<br>
                    <br>

                    Developed the habit of squatting to piss, which often reveals shitting or farting as well. Healthy.
