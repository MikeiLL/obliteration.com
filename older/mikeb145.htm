          Damn. What a week. We bought a $24.00 air mattress after having to leave a gorgoeus house in Birmingham 'cause
          there was no bed or carpeting. Good move. Rivka's currently pumping it with air.<P>
            Shit gigs, open mics, ditturbingly disordered homes, intense heat, bad bands, band member quiting (for a few
            hours anyway) and 40 pmh on the hi-way 'cause we blew the transmission.
          <P>
            Played a show in Athens, GA with Hasil Adkins and they insisted I play solo (with Rivka) and couldn't pay us
            (not $20, not $10, not a dime).
          <P>
            Have you read <U>Get in the Van</U> by Henry Rollins. Great book. He complains about the misery of life on
            the road. I'll paraphrase: It's fucking cold outside. The tire blew so those guys had to unload the whole
            truck and put everything back in again. Some chick said something dumb to me, so I told her to go die. I
            worked out for an hour and wrote in my journal, then I couldn't even find a good pot of coffee.
          <P>
            Whoa Henry, that's rough. We just played an open mic for 10 people, cooked out front the bar, did the dishes
            behind the bar, sold 1 CD to another poor musician and spent our last $50.00 on a crack-motel. Tomorrow I'll
            be booking dates on a cell phone we can't pay for from the back of a mini-van that can't pull this trailer.
          <P>
            Cancelled tonights gig in South Carolina 'cause the van's being repaired. (Had to borrow money from everyone
            we know). Band sounds better than ever. We had a great show Friday at W6 house in Auburn (where our friends
            Plug Spark Sanjay also play). Punk/Blues band Immortal Lee County Killers are from Auburn.
          <P>
            Hopefully we'll make it to Nashville in time to interview on-air at the Vanderbilt U. radio station.
          <P>
            If I sound negative, it's all in fun.
