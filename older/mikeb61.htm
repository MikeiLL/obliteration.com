          <P>First time we met was at an audition for the McDonalds Jazz Band when we were like, fifteen.
            Neither of us got in (thank goddess). A few years later we
            hooked up in Boston when his friend James got some acid from Zef and me. Last night Mark's band
            <A Href="http://www.punkmambo.com" target="_parent">Babaloo</A> played in Manhattan. Fuckin' Amazing.
          </P>
          <P> <B>Punk Mambo</B> they call it. Babaloo is a Santera diety, represented by the Western saint San Lazaro,
            a cripled leper. Mark says they didn't know that when they named the band. Babaloo is the best punk band,
            and
            the rawest latin band I know.
          <P> Woke up this morning to the sound of teeth moving in my mouth ... don't ask. Wonder how Jesus felt
            after three days dead. Bet there wasn't a coffee maker in the tomb.
