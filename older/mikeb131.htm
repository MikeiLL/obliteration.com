        Nuts, nuts, nuts, motherfuckin' nuts.<BR>
        Hmmm. Why I share these intimate details with any anonamous internet user I'm not sure. Ego trip.<BR>
        Left Dirty Harry. Not happy. Some say it's a big fool who'd pass up this opportunity at being in a huge
        commercial rock band, just to pursue a career as an obscure 'weird music' artist for whom which selling a few
        hundred records is a success.<BR>
        Yes, I'm feeling a bit insecure. Think about Steve Albini, Tom Waits, Billy Bragg and Woody Guthrie. How will I
        feel five years from now, when the Dirty Harry people are all well off rock stars? Man, the truth is; I dig
        Nirvana and Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Ministry, early Chili Peppers but this isn't that. Even though it
        probably will make money; are we all supposed to put our integrity and passion aside for a few pieces of colored
        paper? Symbolising the blood-won power of the imperial entertainment dynasty?<BR>
        Competing with each other to see who can conform the most? Be the most mundane? Fighting for the
        one-in-a-million place at the top of the cock-sucker pyramid?<BR>
        And I'm not saying I'm any better. We each have to answer to our own heart. Poverty is very romantic isn't it?
        Am I right to dedicate my life to raw, indulgent, rebelious creation? I shouldn't just put aside what I want for
        two years so that I can have more "industry credibility" later? When they choose, they choose fro the knowns,
        right?<BR>
        Stay in this band and spend the rest of my life believing Mike iLL music will be relegated to the
        ultra-underground, invisible, dust-covered cavities of 7" geeks and the odd-ball serendipitous fan? Isn't it
        about making shit that's alive in the universe, and dwells not on pieces of plastic, but in the minds and souls,
        in the very fabric of the universe?<BR>
        I mean, who the fuck am I? Haven't I lived a thousand times and been rich and poor, famous, happy, successful,
        revered, dispised, addicted, tragic before? Don't I know that Love is everything and work is love made visible,
        and doing shit that's bad for the heart is just opening me up to the demons of anxt, anuii, boredom, depression
        and discontent? Don't I remember my last death-bed revalation that a life dedicated to swimming in rot-gut
        diarrhea is a life discarded and a miracle ignored? Now THAT's a missed opportunity.<BR>
        I've seen a million fuckin' loosers like me spend a couple of years playing with some "next big thing/industry
        darling" and end up with nothing but a few more wrinkles, a bit less hair and a nose job anyway. So like KRS-ONE
        says, "If it ain't fun, you're done." And it's not that it couldn't be fun, for someone who's into getting high
        all the time and having anti-love sex and not being bothered by being part of a blood-thirsty machine.<BR>
        Being a rebel is part of my personality, my nature, but being revolutionary is my heritage. And a revolutionary
        knows he's dead - Huey Newton.<BR>
        So I may be buried before I'm born, but so are you and I'm full of shit, but at least it's funky. I'm gonna pick
        up my big pair of hairy, heavy balls and continue on down the wooded path, alone. The old strait path? Well,
        it's the one where the hobos and the fairies are at.<BR>
        This goes out to Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Bunny Wailer, Isadora Duncan, Bela Bartok,
        William Blake, Henry Miller, John Lovett, Drew Blood, Joie DBG, Lach, John Kessel, Doc Boggs and Job. And anyone
        who reads this, and the people who inspire me and encourage me and who I inspire and all those who have the
        courage to live in reality. Re-fuckin'-ality man, money doesn't exist here, I'm sorry.<BR>
        I'm back in the van with a pail full of books, CDs, veggies, attitude and of course; peanut butter. Like we said
        back in ninety-five; "Fuck dem hoes."

        Heard this great story about (now this is an eye witness account) Tim Leary going to Angola or Algeirs or
        wherever Eldridge Cleaver was hangin' in Exile, and Eldrige was an ill hood, and ended up kidnapping Leary by
        taking his passport as ransom trying to get ten grand for his latestbook project or something. Think the guy who
        was telling me wrote this book <U>In Search of the Eternal High</U> or something like that. Should get the data
        strait, but whatever the "truth" be. If you know who Cleaver and Leary are you're getting a chuckle and a tear,
        aren't you?
