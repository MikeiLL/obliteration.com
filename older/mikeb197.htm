      <TD><tt>My friend from waaaaay back in the day. I've seen everything with this woman, often for the first
          time.</tt>
        <P><tt><BR>
            She's got a TV show she wrote coming on TV on Wednesday, so please watch it. Here's the info:</tt>
        <p>I just wanted to remind everyone to tune in to PBS&nbsp;this Wednesday night (Oct. 6th, at 9pm):<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          PBS Previews | PBS Hollywood Presents &quot;Cop Shop&quot;<br>
          It's the premiere of the first two episodes of&nbsp; &quot;Cop Shop,&quot; a new tv series created by
          my&nbsp;dear friend and writing partner, David Black (Law &amp; Order, CSI, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;David wrote the
          first episode, &quot;Fear,&quot; which tells the story of a community meeting between police officers and
          local residents on the verge of panic over a series of rapes in the neighborhood.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          I wrote the second episode, &quot;Blind Date,&quot; which airs at 9:45. It features Richard Dreyfuss as a vice
          detective with a weakness for vice -- drugs, gambling, hookers, you name it. He finds himself at a whorehouse
          where all the girls are 12-steppers, and has an unexpected encounter with a hooker played by Rosie
          Perez.&nbsp;&nbsp;My episode also stars Chris Lawford as a crooked cop, and Rita Moreno as the madam, Mary
          Alice.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          We've gotten some great reviews so far: Entertainment Weekly says, &quot;No one really makes 'em like this
          anymore. Teleplays in the purest sense of the word..&quot; We're also a &quot;Hit&quot; in the &quot;Hits
          &amp; Misses&quot; section of TV Guide. According to Matt Roush, &quot;It feels like a good night spent
          off-Broadway.&quot; We also got some good coverage from the NY Times and the Wall Street Journal, but I
          haven't seen them yet, since I get all my news from TV Guide.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          As you may have heard, PBS ended up having to bleep some words -- &quot;shit,&quot; &quot;fuck,&quot; and
          &quot;blowjob&quot; -- rather than face huge fines from the FCC. I'm not thrilled about being bleeped; it's
          un-American, but it was also good publicity. And the beauty part&nbsp;is that while the censors were looking
          for dirty words, they completely overlooked the salacious content. We got away with references to lubricants,
          pill-popping rabbis, half-and-halfs, Holy Communion, men in diapers...in other words, the kind of stuff you've
          come to expect from me over the years...<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Anyway, thanks for your support, and I hope you enjoy the show!<br>
