          <Font face="Times, Ariel, Chicago,Courier New" Size=+2>This kid picked me up on Eigth Ave. the other night.
            I'd just taken a cab up to 58th Street an' call this girl from a payphone at 1:A.M.; No Answer...call again
            same shit (answreing machine).
            Fine, I really don't give a shit some chick I slept with on the road, great ass...wow.</FONT>
        </P>
        <P>
          <Font face="Times, Ariel, Chicago,Courier New" Size=+2>Anyway, I'm walking back to the path train, and this
            guy starts walking with me. About my age. Neither of us got nothin' to do so we end up in his
            allmost-nothing-NYU-Law-student-apartment. We kiss briefly, and suck each other off...shower, diner, and
            good-bye.
            We talked about homophobia, drugs, and making money. My mouth tasted like cock the whole next day. I'm glad
            I did that, that's pretty wild shit for me. Well...</FONT>

          <Font face="Times, Ariel, Chicago,Courier New" Size=+2>Man, there's so much insane sex, and drug shit I wanna
            record. Just stuff from our past. This complete stranger comes into the bathroom at the
            Black and Blue Ball asking "can I hold your dick while you pee?", she's hot as hell too. We've had some
            great times since then,
            and we still friends. ILLNESS may be back on the scene soon, but don't say anything.</FONT>
