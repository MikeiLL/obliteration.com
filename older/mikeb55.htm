          History is written by the victors. I admit too much ignorance to be of any<BR>
          political use, but as an artist I take the right to express my feelings:<BR>
          <BR>
          Sex and voilence are taken from us by the rich (Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch<BR>
          ...), and fed back through their own $$$$ channels.<BR>
          <BR>
          Death is taken from us by killer religions/real estate brokers.<BR>
          <BR>
          Music is stolen by corperations (Viacom???). Take great European bands like<BR>
          <A HREF="http://www.czukay.de/" target="_newbrowser">Can</A> or <A
            HREF="http://users.skynet.be/sky42663/deus/index.htm" target="_newbrowser">Deus</A>. If the market was not
          flooded with commercial (ie: doesn't<BR>
          question the following beer commercial) music - these great artists would<BR>
          naturally rise to the top, unfortunately the channels are controlled by<BR>
          greedy white males and their insecure women.<BR>
          <BR>
          Americans are so arrogant - we really think we're the best. We live on<BR>
          borrowed time, eating off the backs of 90% of the earths population.<BR>
          history will not be kind to us.<BR>
          <BR>
          Our kids are strung out on sugar, teenagers on alcahol, our elderly die of<BR>
          loneliness.<BR>
          <BR>
          Spend a dime on censorship? how about some instruments in the school system?<BR>
          How about teachers of Hip-Hop music and culture hired out of our many ghettos?<BR>
          <BR>
          These are the new dark ages. Aim to realise the music of dreams. To hell<BR>
          with current pop - most of it future landfill. CD's will be funny when our<BR>
          kids grow up.<BR>
