        <TT>Crizazy Wacked gigs these past two days. Monday and Tuesday hit Arlington, Virginia and Richmond. Performed
          great, but lost money. Moved all our shit to Pensacola (Florida) pulling the 8' x 5' trailer with this used
          Ford Econoline (X-Tra Lagre) and the gas mileage is a-fuckin-trocious. What-ever (like the song says).<BR>
          Discovered the majik of truck stop showers, but the truckers don't like you if it ain't a semi, so you have to
          sleep in the main lot where it's noise as shit. And waking up in the 11:00 AM heat gets tired pretty fast. One
          night we got woken up middle of the night to move and ended up leaving the parking lights on all night. Probly
          did some damage to the new battery.<BR>
          By bro Various from BlesteNation is upstairs here at Mom and Dad's practicing to one of Fafu's new
          (ultra-dope) beats.<BR>
          Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth recently produced 6 Mad Happy tracks which sound really dope. Featuring the mad
          turntablism of <a href="http://www.kraftjerks.com" target="_newbrowser">Kid Ginseng</A>. That's exciting. Hard
          as hell to keep us booked enough to make enz meet, but it seems to be happening. Love the way our fans dance.
          Some new shit. Wonder what the summer of 2003 has in store (for us all).<BR>
          Props to Carrie and my new Brother Armen. Y'all rock hard.
