Man, I fuckin' HATE when people have to crank the AC up to freezing in the Pensacola heat. We play at a cool little cafe tonight called, Van Goughs.<P>
Dan and April rock for putting us up though. Rivka and I slept in the guest room last night. Women are a trip. Been with this one for a long time and it's amazing.<P>
The other day Mike Shockley was so funny; "Women were put here to yell at us. We need to be yelled at. That's what they do."<P>
Fuckin' love that Delaware boy.<P>
Our bass player's a bit of a loner. His mother's coming over to hang with him today. Hope he's okay. Spelled his fucking name wrong on the CD (I'm an asshole) and he don't wanna give her a copy. We're gonna try and doctor one up. It's Crag, not Grag. Crag is the Scottish people used to live in the caves by the sea. Where the name Craig comes from.<P>
Hey - Mad Happy rock. Buy our record (if you can swing it) or fuck you. No. I shouldn't say that.<P>
Hey. Thanks for the support. Glad you dig it.
