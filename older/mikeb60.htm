          They aim to raise the pay standard for punk/rock musicians like us. Pretty cool, it's time -
          the Union structure from the 30's isn't working 4 us right now.
          <P>Saw <A Href="http://www.igc.apc.org/deepdish/lockdown/ww3/index.html" target="_parent">Seth Toboccoman</A>
            and <A Href="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/ranaldo.htm" target="_parent">Lee Ronaldo</A> performing last
            night in the city,
            pretty cool stuff - Seth's work is really powerfull. Hearing Lee (reading from his new book of 1980's
            journal entries, on
            <A Href="http://www.softskull.com" target="_parent">SoftSkull Press</A>) made me wanna write about
            S+M/Heroin/Crack
            parties at Paradise
            Lost.
          <P>Seeing Otter perform for the first time was great. She comes out on stage at the Pyramid Club totally
            naked except for high heels, and reads a piece about foot-fucking an old boyfriend in New Orleans. This
            woman seems like fun.
            She's got surgically implanted fangs. At one point I remember her sucking me off on the couch, while
            sticking syringes through my nipples, get stiff just
            thinking about it.
          <P>Some day I'll write about hanging from the ceiling, being electricuted by her (foot in her vagina) and
            mistress Salome,
            in a room full of young freaks. That was fun.
