          Yea, it has been a long time. I ain't got shit to say either. My girl Dana Cerick from DC via Nashville
          performs up this way next week. Monday at Continental 8:30, Wednesday at CBGBs MIDNITE.<BR>
          She's really cool and her music real good too. Last time I was in Nashville; played a great/packed variety
          show and met a ton of cool people, including Lucinda Williams (roots music diva). I told her my man Boo
          Reiners from Demolition String Band taught me about her. Said something about country music and she's like, "I
          don't play country". I was like, "I don't mean what's on the radio today as 'country music'". She was real
          cool and down to earth.<BR>
          Told me Lou Reed died and we were all bummed out. Day or two later I heard an confirmed that it was a hoax.
          Interesting. How about Joey Ramone? Anybody die today?<BR>
          Play me a song not meant to make me feel small. The good folks in Nashville quoted Bono (of U2), "A red
          guitar, three chords and the truth". Nice.<BR>
          How about Beck's, "Give the finger to the rock 'n' roll singer, as he dances upon your pay check".<BR>
          Dreampt the other morning of a tiny down and out style gospel church on Madison Ave. in Ney York where me and
          this rich gir smoked pot with the pastor who turned into a James Brown alien with a big green forhead.<BR>
          We seek the point of it all and wonder why we get stuck. Life is like a sword, seek the handle instead of the
          point. Oh, I don't know. How 'bout this great AA saying; The definition of insanity is doing the same thing
          and thinking it'll produce different results. Courtesy of Andy Action.<BR>
          Last night I was really super-happy with Poor Old Souls recordings.<BR>
          Hell minus desire equals what?<BR>
          Kudos to my man in Montgomery, AL (where Hank died) who digs up the past and gives flesh to skeletons like
          me.<BR>
          I wanna give you all tears 'till my heart turns to wet clay.<BR>
          Can we die in a cave instead of hospital?<BR>
          Good goddess save us from the George Bush within. These are scary times. Very scary. It's an easy time to be
          an outlaw. Less and less to lose hourly.<BR>
          How dare a full grown man fly a freak flag without a million-dollar pay check?<BR>
