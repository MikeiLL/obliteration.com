<FONT SIZE="+2">Thing that's sucking pretty bad right now is I think I left a bag sitting in a club's parking lot
at 4:30 A.M the other night after hanging out with the last of the drunken patrons.<P>
In this bag is all the CD money from the tour (about half of it in travelers checks thank gooddess), and a
couple of hundred mailing list names, plus all the business cards and numbers and shit I've collected 
over the last 4 1/2 weeks. So hopefully it's either lost amongst the million piles of clothes in this girls 
dorm room, or it'll turn up.<P>
Basically though, everything's cool. I mean, loosing ALL those mailing list names is a pretty massive suck,
but what can you do? Shyte happens. Met this guy the other day who'se closing down his music store
'cause the nerve coverings in his ears wore away due to chemicals or something, and he's got tenitis.
It's kind of like having constant radio interference in your head. They gave him cortezone for the ears,
and it ended up fucking his eyes up, so now he can't hardly see. So I've got my health, shit, as he put it;
every day you've got your health is a good day.<P>
God I hope I find this fuckin' bag. Just gonna feel like such an asshole if it's gone.<P>
Like, you have to take it out of the trunk to pack in the amp and CD's and shit, and I usually lean it up against the
car... Oh man...<P>
Found some cool used pants here in Atlanta yesterday. Rock 'n' Roll. Gotta look in the women's section.<P>
Love y'all. Wish me luck.
