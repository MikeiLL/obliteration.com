<Font Face="Comic Sans MS, Comic">Happy Halloweeeeeeen. Egyptian planes are crashing, and the Yankees won the series again. 
Little kids are trick or treating in Barney and Bart Simpson costumes. 
Sometimes these words are written only to keep you coming back.<BR>
This tour is going amazing. Everybody thinks they're the only one who likes it. Ha haaaaa. Little do they know.<BR>
Check out these Gravediggaz lyrics:<BR><BR>
I floss my teeth on the Gospel tracks<BR>
I'm not an apostle, but i bring the axe to your back.<BR>
I <i>something</i> and attack like Crest on Plaque...<BR><BR>
Shit, forget the words. He says something about your <B>mole</B> separates from your <B>soul</B> behold the gravediggaz told you BEWARE, 
but you didn't listen, so now your ear drums glisten Ha haaaaaa.<BR>

Anyway, check out this thing written for a friends web magazine:<BR><BR></FONT><TT>

As an artist, you can try to make people like what you do, you can try to do what people will like, or you can do what you do and find people who like it.
I'm what is known as an indie (independent) artist, which means I'm not dependant on a corporate entity for the advancement of my career.

Sitting at the moment at a desk in a farmhouse 40 miles south of Waco, Texas, writing on an old Apple laptop computer. Mike Dillon (of Billygoat, Critters Buggin, Hairyapes BMX and sometimes Brave Combo) is next to me booking shows from New Years to February. This is he and his wife Kim's house (cold water, outhouse, beehives and everything -- penny's a day), where I'm staying between shows Mike has hooked up opening for his bands out here.

It's an eight week tour around the Southeastern US. A 1985 Ford LTD, guitar, amplifier (w/ microphone, cable and stand in case of need), tent, sleeping bag, coleman stove and cooler. Also a couple of books, clothes, bathroom stuff and notebooks. On nights off I hit bars in a new town and sell CD's, perform or just find out where to play in the next tour. Things have been going very well. It feels divine to wake up in a rest stop and make green tea in the warm Texas fall.

Hit the town of Clarksdale, Mississippi a few nights ago. A club called Hobson Preservation Company, referred by my hostess in Memphis. I went there on a Monday night and performed for the bartender, who called the owner down. This place is soooo cool... It's and old cotton farm-come antique store-come blues bar. The place is huge, and full of the coolest old stuff from back in the day; a barber shop, a post office, cotton scales, lots of old books, guitars and pictures. It's run as a not-for-profit collective. The owner of the place ended up letting me sleep there for he night, and will probably be inviting a bunch of locals down for a show on the way back from Texas.
<BR>
People bought CD's in three other bars and a 'blues pawnshop' in town as well. One place they even hooked up some complimentary mississippi style sausage. That was the place some old rednecks told me not to dare go; "the nigers'l steal from ya - if not wurse".
<BR>
Anyway, the CD; "The Seduction of Sarah Sahonie" is Punk/Blues style - just voice and guitar, some of us call it Antifolk (there's a whole scene in New York and Philladelphia). It's a lot of work calling clubs, radio stations and press, playing the music and getting from gig to gig, even with the help of a manager, agent and promotion company (all working VERY inexpensively), but it's more than worth it; there's no choice if it's what you're born for - you just do it.
<BR>
To be driving down an unexplored highway listening to Woody Guthrie, and watching towns of 1500 people pass by... Taking your shirt off on the side of the road and learning a new tune (while it's freezing back at home), turning someone on to some music like they've never heard before... F'Geta-boudit baby,
Tha BOMB.
