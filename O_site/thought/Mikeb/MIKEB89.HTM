<FONT SIZE="+2">Much better mood today...<P>
Won $60 dollars at an open mic last night at a very cool place called
 <A Href="http://www.eddiesattic.com/" target="_newbrowser">Eddie's Attic</A>.
The owner Eddie runs the thing, and he just really loves the music. He's friends with all these "antifolk" artists; 
Ani DeFranco, Ed Hamell, Roger Manning... Was telling me about this cat Alejandro Escovedo who suposedly Ed Hamell
 knocked on his door and moved in with him in Austin years ago because "He's the best songwriter alive today".<P>
 So, I'ma go back again this Friday for a final contest with a $1000 dollar prize... Damn, I hate contests.
 Charles Ives said "Prizes are badges of mediocracy". I'l just think of it like, it's really a contest to see 
 if the judges are cool enough to know what's up..... sure could use that $1000 though.<P>
 Hoping to hear some really cool shit... Rivka will be with me, she loves the soft, soulfull stuff...
 I just wanna get fucked. Ha ha, just kidding. Make me cry, and you can have money.
