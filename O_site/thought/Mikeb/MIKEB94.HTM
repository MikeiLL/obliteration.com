<FONT SIZE="+2">Happy New Year (the new millenium starts next year). What a fucking night... er coupla days...
<P>Went up to Natures Friends Farm in Pompton Lakes, NJ. It's an artist community on this old piece
of sacred Native American land. Lot's of elder healers come through there, and they have a sweat lodge
and stuff... These are people who live their lives based around the knowledge that spiritualism and
naturalism are greater than materialism. Folks work hard, they hard core. I was talkin' to kids out there 
who like, live in the hills for weeks at a time, and deal with bears and shit... My man Nesta's like,
 (well, we we're talkin' about tryina find and keep love, and suicide (like, almost doing it) and how Bunny Wailer
 (of The Wailers) dissapears and lives in the bush in Jamaica and he's all alone, and nobody see's him for
 weeks and stuff) if you come accros a bear in the woods you'll smell him first, they smell really bad. 
 And he's like, just stand there with your arms spread out, and don't run, so he knows you're a hunter too.
 And like, if he get's aggressive, you gotta be like "Yo Asshole, i'm man motherfucker, i controll
 fire and bombs and guns and shit, so get tha hell outta here 'fore i kill your ass". just like talking 
 down a drunk on the street (accept that you might be able to beat up or run from the drunk). Of 
 course my man Byron was remiding me later that mostly a bear will be runnin' from your ass. Funny thing is,
 Byron saw a bear sleeping under a tree behind the sweat lodge the same night.<P>
 The whole sweat lodge thing is cool, they build a huge fire and put all these rocks in it, then have this
 ceremony with age and tobacco and chanting and stuff, and bring the rocks in to this big cloth and 
 wood igloo-lookin-thing and put water on it 'till you think you're gonna catch fire or something, you can barely even breath
 'cause it's all hot steam... and the sweat comes pouring out of you like a rainstorm, you're almost
 naked (or naked) of course.<P>
 Then, my one new friend is tellin' me about her parents telling her "there's two kinds of women in
 the world, ones with looks, and ones with brains. you better start workin on the brains". She started being suicidal at 
 age seven, and her first major attempt was at age nine. She ended up getting involved with this 
 Jewish religious community who hooked her up with a husband that beat the shit out of her, molested (or
 tried to molest her daughter) and raped her every night. Once he knocked her tooth out, held her on the floor
 and shoved it back in. And the religious people blame her!<P>
 That's some pain I can't even begin to imagine, and i doubt you can either. the wisdom in these eyes, as 
 she tells me crying, that she just wants half-a-heart's worth of love. Reminding me of Lyell's girl
 who was born three weeks ago with only half a heart. She might live a normal life too... so maybe we 
 all have twice as much heart as we really need.<P>
 Feel for my junkie friends who loose teeth and liver... one loveable dude is on enough methadone every day
 to kill 'strait' people. He's like, "I'm ready for surgery 24-7 and this is clean for me." <P>
 Stories about drive up to the back door in a car with stolen plates, fill a shopping basket with Tylenol
 and shit, and just kick open the fire door or walk right out the front door and skidaddle the hell out of there,
 an sell the shit for like $200.00 to some fence in a bar who sells it cheap at a roadside flea market.
 He's like, how do you think they can sell all that shit so cheap? It's fed by 10 thousand crack-head-junkies
 accross the country pullin' stunts like this and whatever, just to keep from being sick.<P>
 Hey, thanks for the eye's. Let's all keep learning how to pray. Listen to other folks talk to our creator,
 and learn to open the heart 'till it makes you cry.
