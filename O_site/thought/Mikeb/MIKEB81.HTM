<TT>Writing from a tent in the yard of an  old plantation-come-antique store-come blues bar-soon to be Blues University.
Hobson's Preservation Company.
Clarksdale, Mississippi. At the intersection of Rt.'s 61 and fourty-something, basically where the Delta Blues was born.<P>
Monday night (October 18th), played here tonight, then went into town and sold CD's in local bars.<P>
These old fuckin' racists tried to scare me away from one place where they ended up buying CD's AND feeding me for free.<P>
Another place, Mingles is owned by a guy who used to be in ("old scool" rapper) Sir Mix-A-Lot's band. He wants to book me for the BET comedy show they're doing in a few weeks.<P>
Life is grand.<P>
Now It's Saturday afternoon at a hundred year old farm house which was empty for 20 some-odd years 'till Mike and Kim from Billygoat started living here. It's all cold ater, out-house
chickens, rattle snakes and four dogs. There's a lot of stars up there, really. The nearest bar is a shack with no windaws and no neon.<P>
Been going into bars on nights of and just walking up to people selling CD's, pretty cool actualy. I could live like this.
