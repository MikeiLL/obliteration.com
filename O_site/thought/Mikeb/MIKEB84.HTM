<FONT SIZE="+2">Asleep and Stoned as shit. FUlled wyth Southern diner food, biscuita n grayveee. Hangin' with this one dude, man what a trip. Homeboy's drunker than funkin drunk,like... total...
<BR>He goes "I wish you were young like me, so you could understand".<BR>
Got this big. he's showin me this big abscess in his elbo joint. 'bout the size of a medium gum ball.<BR>
Up there (Michigan, where he's from.), we... those were the good old days. These aren't the good old days, these days suck.<BR>
<BR>Shooting liquid acid and heroin. hmmm<P>
Homeboy was really sweet. Played percussion and listened like a motherfucker all night. Not a MUSICIAN, but
maybe better for it. Owns a 4 chair ("that doesn't matter") hair salon.<P>
Thingza been interesting last coupla week. Awoke on the beach at the Gulf of Mexico monday morning
in Carla's tent with thif dude name Leif. The wind was so funny, and we only had 4 out of 6 pins... going into the sand and everything?
Was just our bodies keeping the thing on the ground. Igrits and Herron (or is it herring?), cranes - 
cool beach birds.<P>
Also seen some long-horn cattle (with very cool long hair), dragonflies, bees, wasps. Some very cool dogs (well,
maybe cool isn't much of a dog word.)<P>
Accidentaly sunk 3 1/2 inches deep in a little bayou today within (I kid you not) five minutes of wearing my new sneakers.
What happened was, got these really cool cotton sneakers fer like twenty-six 79. (This was so great - 
I litterally had twenty six dollars 80 cents including 2.80 in change left of "survival money". (separate that out from CD cash as much as possible)).
Took the shoes off after wearing them off the floor (big toe needs air), and get in the car. Later at this bridge
pulled over in the Louisianna rt i20 at a little bayou. And just suffice to say it looked firm.<P>
There's been times yesterday and tonight where it looked like there wouldn't be a gig, but both nights turned out great.
Yesterday an hour 1/2 set for no money at a joint in Shreveport Luisianna, then an hour live radio set at Centenary College.
Today we got to the gig late, and there was some serious weirdness, but the man came through and we did a gig (we includes my man Tim who
hooked me up two weeks ago on the Don't Know thing 1 about El Dorado (thats raydo. El DoRayDo, not RahDo) Visit, Jeff the owner of The Mast, and a few other cool folks.
We went back to this bands studio they call the Dojo afterwards, then a local Diner. Now it's like five in the morning and Tim has to leave the house at 8.<P>
Meaning manana tengo que drive at 8 ayemm and start playing in Clarksdale Mississippi at Hobsons at 4:30, Mingles and 8:00, very likely (and hopefully) Millenium at one ayem or something.
<P>Fuck, tired. Gotta put this up and answer e-mail while I have the chance.<P>Jeff Buckley.
