<TT>Hey. It's eight ayemm on October fifteen here in the parking lot of some closed down camping park in beautifull Bristol Tennessee. Sleeping in the car isn't gonna work too well (being that the old knees feel like a coupla tennis balls), gonna have to figure out the whole tent thing. And yo, as far as December gigs go - I got's ta hook up some places to stay, cause I think the whole temperature thing might get pretty damn iLL, if ya know what I'm sayin'.<P>
So anyway, guess this is like, the first morning of the tour. Actually the first day was s'posed to be last Sunday, but those car troubles did some work on the schedule. Oh yea, and the list of all the clubs and contacts was actually erased over by the last diary entry, so hopefully it was enjoyed. So now it's Saturday morning, I'm in Memphis tonight. Right now it's laptops and green tea on the Coleman stove. Washed out mouth with Dr. Bronners soap (thanks for the tip Big Steph).<P>
Check it out, last night me and Rusty (with the tattooed face) went to a Presbyterian church down here in memphis. It ws so cool - total Southern Testifying style. The people we're so friendly. The way I got there was the Pastor, this guy Bill who's like an ex-biker and shit - been shot 6 times in Vietnam, and once here - got saved in a tent revival. The music was great (not pro or anything...)<P>
There was one couple there of husband and wife (very young), who travel around from ministry to ministry. She plays and sings and he preaches. Supposedly the day they met at a revival he asked her, "I've been praying for a wife, doyou play piano?".<P>
That's the shit. So if you're in memphis, you gotta check out Harvest Time Ministries on the corner of National and (3511) Mayfair. If nothing else, it's much more of a slice of Memphis culture than Graceland will ever be.
