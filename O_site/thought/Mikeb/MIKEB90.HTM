<FONT SIZE="+2">Well, didn't win the Eddie's Attic contest. Four out of five judges prefered the 
folk-pop duo I was paired up against. Well. $1,000 woulda been nice, but other than that, it's not my business.
Shows been going well, and my woman's been on tha road here too. Sex in the back seat, front seat of car...
Also in the wooded area behind a rest area two days ago. Wonderfull to feel the sun beating on my naked erection while she stands above, dress pulled up,
my mouth between thighs<P>
Today we awoke at Aunt Kathy and Unkle Mike's house. They are soooo sweet, and the house is beautifull.
Mike wakes up at quarter to five in the morning to go to the gym. That's fuckin' hard-core man, makes me feel kinda
guilty for my life-style. Guilt being a constant in the life of a Catholic.<P>
Asshole booking agent sucks elephantitis balls through rotten teeth. I wanna knock his eyes out again...
<P>
Happy December.
