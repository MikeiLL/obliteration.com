<FONT SIZE="+2">Wow. What a week, what a week, what a week. Hmmm.<P>
Goddess, the sky today between Richmond and Charlotte (Rt. 85)... Was t-shirt weather, and this a gorgeous stretch of road,
 lakes and what looks like miles of evergreen trees. The sunset though, Oh my Goddesses. Know when
 clouds look like streched out pieces of cotton, completely still to the eye? Well these ones were
 pinkish, almost like the color of blood and semen mixed. And the sky was still bright blue, they call it Carolina
 blue right? Wow, clouds slowly turned to a very dark purple, almost grey.<P>
 Doing a lot of driving on empty lately - wonder exactly how far below E before the car stops moving.
 <P>Played DC on Tuesday, Baltimore on Wednesday, Richmond on Thursday, Fairfax City VA last night and Charlotte tonight.
 Guess Richmond would have to be the most memorable night (aside from sex w/ my love after Baltimore).
 Check this out. Place is called the Hole in the Wall - a fitting name. John who books it is very cool,
 but they don't pay the bands. Of course I had forgotten this... everybody in the joint's broke as shit - 
 made nine bucks for two CD's (pocket's been on E this week big time too).<P>
 Place to crash? This is fuckin' classic: This homegirl Jess who's apprenticing as a tattooist hooks me up 
 with this older cat and two other younger guys. They're all wasted on alcohol. We go back to this
 auto body shop or something where they have drums and amps and shit set up, and they make me play (well, maybe not quite <i>Make</I>)
 bass with their band, The Nazi Niggaz.<P>
 Stylistically I'ma hafta call it Noise/Punk/Shit-Rock. We were stoned as hell, and sippin' from a big bottle
 of espresso brandy. The guy on drums is so drunk he can't hardly look. We were getting into some ill grooves..
 My man Tony's playing all these hard-core punk riffs real loud on guitar, and every once in a while
 the shaman (whose shop we're in) jumps up on a table or something and screams shit which is inaudible
 above the instruments, but looked very sincere?<P>
 He screams "Are you queer?". I'm like, "Yea, sure.".<P>
 Then he's tellin' me "Yea, watchin' you play with your shirt off and stuff, and you were makin' all this
 eye contact... it was like seeing Iggy Pop, my hero.<BR>
 "I'd love to have your cock up my ass."<P>
 I'm like, "Oh. That's funny, 'cause I was lookin' at you like 'cool, this guy's really diggin' the music."<P>
 Ya know, that's a big fear, people don't really like your music, they just want something from you.
 Either sex or money or friendship or respect or a piece of you, or they wanna do what you're doing...
 But who can blame us? We're all sorta like that right? Guess the true appreciator of music is a very rare
 and precious thing. That's what Greg Taminga was. Wish I had seen you in the hospital while you were dying man.<P>
 Don't ever miss the chance to see a friend die.<P>
 
 Boy, that got dark.<P>
 
 Rivka left a roach (not the insect) in her aunts bathroom and ended up cutting her stay there short.
 Supposedly she wasn't smoking in the house but... hey Ellen, if you're reading this, hope you're not too
 dissappointed or bummed. We had a great stay there...<P>
 
 Looking forward to sleep at home next week. Oh yea, back to Richmond. Drove these two dudes back to their
 place, and they said I could stay there ("but only for one night, that's the one rule"). Unfortunately 
 after going out to the car to get toothbrush and stuff, they never answered the door to let me back in.
 Took it as a sign (thank you mother)... napped in the car, and dropped CD's off at some local music stores, record store
 and one cool looking diner.<P>
 
 Hung with a very cool 12 year old tonight. His dad was fuckin' wasted - biker lookin' dude. This kid reminded
 me of childhood friend Nadhim. Very mature for his age, smart, down to earth, passionate. We talked about music.
 Hopefuly he'll be getting his first bass soon, and be able to jam with a couple of schoolmates.<P>
 Homeboy said he feel's like he's known me all his life, and I'm his brother. I'll be your brother, brother.
 He kissed me on the cheek. That's one bad-ass 12 year old.
 This band from DC, "The Dogs of Disco". Really cool - Bad Brains meets Mr. Bungle.<P>
