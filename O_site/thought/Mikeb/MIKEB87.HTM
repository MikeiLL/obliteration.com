<FONT SIZE="+2">To be the sickest page possible, linking to <A Href="http://www.all.com">All Crap</A>, and
<A Href="http://www.wetcunt.com">All iLL</A>. Real raw and <A Href="http://www.random.com">random</A>.<P>
Head up here goes back and forth between, hey there's millions of us... billions of us in here, and loosing
a months worth of contacts and cash is not a big deal. It goes between that and <A Href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&sc=on&q=%27where+the+fuck+is+it%3F%27&kl=XX&stype=stext">
Where the fuck is it?</A><P>
Girl I been staying with is sick with a sore throat, clinical depression, chocolate fiend, thinks she's fat (she's hot!),
blowing off classes, and got fired from work today. She sleeps 'till four o'clock. Dad's a self made man,
real estate developer or something... Oh to be 18 again.<P>
No fuckin' money left, and keep thinking <A Href="http://www.beach-net.com">that money could've gone to..</A>. Then it'll be like
But fuck it yo, I'm on tour playing music I love, people are really digging it... it's the beginning of the rest... bla bla bla.<P>
Ate <A Href="http://www.diennet.com/binge.htm">too fuckin' much</A> last night, mainly out of depression. It's like loosing this bag just put
a hitch in everything. Keep thinking "where the fuck is it?". Tryina picture last time seen and shit...<P>
Yo my girl took me out to some ghetto out here to go to the home of this <A Href="http://www.thefolkartgallery.com">
folk artist</A>, Willie Jinx (i dunno how you spell it). He had moved out of the house, but this other old lady who lived there
showed us some of her stuff, and we bought three pieces for like twenty bucks. Her work is super-raw.
Almost childlike. We got a "Loons Bird", a train (with a picture of two owls on the back) and a picture of
Willie's van. She said we could take whatever we wanted that was left in Willie's yard, some cool stuff too.<P>
This woman's name was Louise. We asked her to sign her stuff andshe's like "Oh, I don't have a license
to do that, Ah cain sine eecuz Ah don' heva laaasenze". We're like "you don't need a license". She's "Realeh?"<P>
When we gave her the money she's like "oh Ah wuz so broke, Ah stayd up x-tra late last night reeedn ma bahble. <BR>
Y'all jis made ma day.<BR>
All sortsa peepl bn comin ba here lookin' fo' Willie (he's so funneh, he always mek me laaf). Wun man,
he dun came bah layus last week in a preety blue van, you probly know 'im..."<P>
Man, wht a trip. She was litterally nailed into hr old ricketty house. "Ma daughtr sed I gotta be caayafoo."<P>
Willie had one picture (he paints on old doors, and pieces of lenolium and glass... whatever) of a guy and a 
big blue whale, written on it were the words "Jonan Wale". A lot of times the words'll be like, barely fitt'n'
on the picture, all curving around the edge and squeezed in at the end.<P>
Anyway, life is great or a fool in a tornado. Bless you all who read this.<P>
Please don't send letters that threaten bad luck to those who don't forward the shit. Don't do that to 
your friends. Sometimes they're funny, but bad luck noone needs.
