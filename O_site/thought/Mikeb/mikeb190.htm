<TT>Hangin' at some Yacht Club at Lake Alatoona, North of Atlanta, GA, with Pam Gore, of <a href="http://www.drumsontheweb.com" target="_newbrowser">Drums on the Web</A>, one of Rivka's oldest and best friends. Gorgeous out here. Bath-warm water. Swimming naked under the near-full blue moon. Not blue in color. "Blue" 'cause it's the second full moon within our calendar month. Think it has more to do with our fucked-up calendar than anything cosmic.<P>
Rent's late and the bitch charges forty dollars late-fee if you get it in one day late. Don't know when we'll have ours. Paid most of it, but she's like "Eyoo tiew peh lay fee". Vietnameese woman. Nice enough, I guess, but a stickler for that rent. "No peh no mo cheh. Cash ohnee."<P>
I'm like, "Okay Giao", pronounced Yah-oh, with emphasis on the yah, "But can we pro-rate it since we gave you most of it?" <BR>
"I no no pro-reh. You peh leh fee."<P>
But enough about me.  What do you think of me?<P>
How 'bout them sound men? The guys who turn the knobs on the sound systems at the clubs we play. A good one is the guy who likes his job, probably likes music and musicians of all types, cares about his sound gear, cares about the show and knows how to make it sound good. He or she probably also knows how to make pro and amateur musicians feel good about themselves and their performances. Those guys are the shit.<P>
Now bad sound men everywhere like roaches. They hate their jobs; hate most styles of music and most musicians, don't care about the gear; probably hate the club and their boss, don't know or care how to make it sound good, have huge, fragile egos and don't want anyone telling them how to do their job. They're either lazy or obsessive, apathetic or uptight, bitter or naive, wasted or jonesing, cynical, jealous or some combination of the above.<P>
We had this one guy recently who had just gotten off tour playing drums with some loud heavy metal band; fucking nightmare. First thing he starts bragging about how "fucking loud" this PA is. (PA stands for Public Address system. The whole sound and lights system modern rock and pop employs was developed my the Nazis to make Hitler sound more omnipotent and mesmerizing. When our presidents speak they have all sorts of state of the art sub-harmonic synthesizers and shit on their voices to make 'em sound like a cross between barry white and darth vader). That scared us from jump,'cause the room looked like the kind of cement cube that turns drums and guitar sounds into bullets, blasting safety pins into your ear drums. Metal drummer boy, the oh so popular heavy metal look: bowling pin figure and potato head face, flanked by thick, dirty-looking dreads, didn't want to do a sound-check. Cool. Actually shit sounded pretty good, but got ugly real quick when we started our electronic set. Actually it started getting weird when he insisted on blasting death metal, which he would play air drums along with, between every band on a hip-hop, acid, spoken word, electro show, even when we supplied CDs to play.<P>
Usually when we're going right into our set without a sound-check (that's where you play some stuff before the show to make sure it all sounds good), we have an "intro" that gives the sound guy, or engineer, or, to be real technical, front of house guy, a chance to get the sounds together. So I start the drum machine and there's nothing coming out. Run back to the sound board and I'm like, "It's playing." He's like, "I'm not gettin' anything." <BR>
"Not on either track?" 
<BR>"You probably forgot to press play."<P>
I run back up to the stage and sure enough, it's playing. From stage I mouth and gesticulate, "It's playing, man." Then the sound comes up in the PA and he goes, on the microphone (they usually have one by the sound board), but I'm not getting the snare track. I go, "Lemme turn the other one on?". Then the other tracks come on and he says, over the microphone, so the audience can hear it, "That's what it was."<P>
Some people don't understand electronic music, and think since it's not "real" instruments, not only does it suck, but it should probably sound like shit, and certainly not be loud. So, we may have made a comment or two asking him to turn something up or down. At one point Rivka goes, to the crowd, "All right, the sound isn't that pumpin' so we need you guys to dance extra hard to rock the place", or something like that, and at the end of the tune they guys says, again over the mic, so everyone can hear it, "If you don't like my system you can stop playing."<P>
That dude was what I would consider a nightmare sound man. Of course it turns out it was one of those all-ages places where everyone there is doing volunteer work anyway, so you can expect some weirdness, and you kind of have to just appreciate that folks are giving the love. But I doubt we'll be back there. Another funny sound-man experience was actually the day before that one. <P>
We get to the club a couple of hours before show time and eventually find the sound man. Start telling him about our set-up and twenty seconds into it he's like, "Hold on a second, dude. I just gotta go smoke a bowl. Be right back." And he disappears with some girl. Time he got back it was pretty much time to start the first band, who sounded good. Then when our boys The iLLs from Norman, Oklahoma got on stage it was all this chaotic running around. They're a four piece band: drums, guitar, keyboards and sax. They keyboards play bass lines.<P>
So they get into their set and you barely hear the bass; only what's coming out of his amp on stage. So I go up to the sound board and I'm like, "I can't hear the bass, man." He goes, "Yea,  it's broken".<P>
I'm like "Well can you go up and FIX it?" It's a matter of replacing a cable or something. He says something about putting a microphone on it and tries to hand ME a microphone and stand. Now, this kid wasn't a volunteer. He get's paid to do this job, so I'm like "No (idiot)." and point at the stage.<P>
So he goes up there and does some stupid shit and goes back to the board, and he's sitting there flirting with his girlfriend and you still can't hear the bass.<P>

So I go back to the sound board and he turns back to the faders. I'm like, "I still can't hear the bass." He turns the input knob up and edges up the fader, and looks at me like, "Cool?". Sounds the same. I look him in the face and turn up to input knob myself. No difference. Then I turn the knob and the fader all the way up and he's like, "There ya go." So I take the fader and slide it all the way up and down repeatedly with no affect on the sound.<P>
He finally got the fuckin' thing working. Wasn't looking too forward to what he'd do with our sound. Whatever.<P>
Listening to this bad-ass college radio station here in the Atanta area; WRAS. All the hip college acts, plus some crazy-ass shit it 3:00 in the morning, RJD2, Kid-606, Chicks on Speed.<P>
Back in the 1980's when "college radio" broke all these punk and underground bands,the shit was a free-for-all, now it's sometimes just a low-budget version of commercial radio stations, playing three chord rock bands that are just the right amount out of tune, and written about in all he right magazines. The kids get paid in T-Shirts, stickers and concert tickets to play the latest "underground" stuff.<P>
All these years and I still want the "cool" kids to accept me. The one's who were cool in grammar school are ugly and bald now, and they look twice my age.<P>
What can you do to be different? Show me someone who's not impressed by fame and fortune. Sure they're out there.<P>
We're all fucked together, but each chasing our own golden carrot, 'till we get cancer and hopefully have the dough for chemo.<P>
In the meantime, at least there is new beauty to be created, shit to fall in love with, wisdom to get excited by and lakes to swim naked in, under the near-full, blue moon.
