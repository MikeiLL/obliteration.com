<FONT SIZE="+2">What an insane fuckin' few daze. Up and down, up and down. The only private space in the car.
Lat week met Meradith when Kevin saw me putting up a sticker 
and was like "Are you Mike iLL?". Ended up spending like 5 days in this dorm room (back here now, just 45 
minutes from Athens where the gig is tomorrow).<P>
Really cool gig at a place in South Carolina called Ground Zero. It's a huge punk club run by desire and
fueled on love. Next day a 6 hour drive to Montgomery to have Patrick tell me "You were s'posed to be here yesterday".<P>
Long and short is, he made me a sandwich and I got back in the car. Stopped for a few minutes by some river
and played "Country Death Song" and "Blister in the Sun" by the Violent Femmes.<P>
Working on "Roxanne" by the Police and "Lover, you shoulda come over" by Jeff Buckley, but those guys sing
so fuckin' high!<P>
Coupla shows this week singing through the amp. It's like fucking with a 2 inch penis (not that I know what that's like LOL).
Yo gotta do a lotta pelvic thrusts to get the point accross. This one show was all redneck-fraternity motherfuckers
askin' for Allman Brothers and shit. It's like screaming into a black hole. I told this one guy who was 
askin' for Matchbox 20, "You're not gonna hear Mike iLL playin'
Matchbox 20, you're gona hear Mike iLL playin' Mike iLL, then  when my stuff is famous you'll be askin' someone else to
play Mike iLL".<P>
Punk/Blues Antifolk. Listen to Hamell on Trial.
