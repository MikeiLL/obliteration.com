										<table><tr><td>Listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBdymtyXt8Y" target="_blank">David Sedaris</a>, which is inspiring. The street name is actually Charles Carrol and not John Carrol Way, which comes from the end of a really stupid Nicholas Cage movie that was on last night. Charles Carrol was like a signer of the Declaration of Independance or something. See? TV being on all the time has its benefits. And maybe these streets weren't named by an ad agency, but by a history buff, and walking around this development will be a vague history lesson, or if nothing less, an inspiration to study American History. A field which always seemed to be little more than forcd patroitism.
													<p>We wrote a musical called Joys of Armageddon. What does the term, &quot;a musical&quot; come from? Is it short for &quot;a piece of musical theater&quot;? Did &quot;musicals&quot; exist before movies or is the term a take-off on &quot;talkies&quot;, which they called the first movies that featured speaking as well as visuals.</p>
