<FONT SIZE="+2">There's two basic philosophies; tell 'em and hope they'll do the same, or 
what they don't know won't hurt 'em.<P>
A stupid sexual indescretion out on tour seemed harmless at the time, but it's a different story when it comes to 
"mentioning" it to your lover. At first I'm like don't mention it, it's no big deal, then we're stoned
driving cback from Brooklyn and it's like "Hmmmm, I'd want to know".<P>
So take a big breath and, "I did something really stupid while I was on tour. I feel really embarrassed about it,
but I gotta tell you 'cause I know I'd wanna know....".<P>
That was two weeks ago. She didn't leave me, but there's a lot of fuckin' hatred going down. Anger, depression...
you know, the kind where you go to bed at 8:00 PM and get up at 3:00 the next day? Yea....<P>
What we had seemed too good to be true and I made sure it wasn't. 
It's not over, but it's stained.... permanently.<P>
Of course monogamy goes against our animal nature, but FUCK! ya know? This thing is so fuckin' amazing.
Now we're in all these vicious cycles of desires, requirements, frustration, I love you, I hate you....<P> Y'all out there
who're experienced in these affairs know it takes fer-fuckin-ever to heal. What a fuckin' asshole. HELLO... trust...?<P>
Whatever. Selfishness breeds selfishness. You hear about these typical musician relationships; 
hurt-anger-apology-forgiveness-do-it-again-and-again-and-again.
That's fuckin' bullshit man. The perpetrator ends up becoming the victim, being consoled for what he's
done to himself again.<P>
So, lot's of massages are in order. It's gonna be a very high hug-to-sex ratio for the next who-knows.
And I pray to the east and i pray to the west and
i pray to the north and pray to the south and the sun and the fire and Venus and Thor and Apollo, Jesus
and Yemaya - can a man be true? Give me strength to me monagamous at least 'till I find out why we should be.<P>
Squirt herself put it best, "I want you all to myself".<P>
Word up on that girl, like-to-the-motherfuckin'-wise.<P>
Oh. Yea ma, that's why I've looked so "serious" these days.<P>
Merry Christmas.
