<FONT SIZE="+2">Man, I feel great. Coupla days from now is the birthday of my first some-type-of-love (not the first, well,
the first woman I was totally in love with. She'd had enough by the miserable end of my first national tour,
and was fucking a mutual friend on my birthday. Eventually she quit Mike iLL, and I ain't heard from her in years.<P>
Shares Frank Sinatra's birthday, December 12th. She's the bomb for having the self-respect and disciplin 
to be silent.<P>
Weather in Richmond is unseasonably warm, beautifull. The night sky out here in the suburbs is full of stars, and with a thin veil of cloud-spray.
Puting me up are a couple who are an accountant and a soldier who's studying to be a nurse. So funny last night singing
"Some will tel you I'll never be happy with the government of this country... Long as citizens starve while we
spending our money on the military, Guess They're Right..". My man's in the front row, we're both looking at each other smiling
and feeling a bit akward. Fact is, I respect a soldier (homeboy knows it), and respect a corporate leader - 
but not the wars they tend to wage.<P>
Just like a "yuppie" is on his or her own path, but as a whole they seem to give nothing back to the community
they gentrify.<P>
Great Punk/Blues jam session the other night at Fat City in Charlotte. This cat <A href="http://www.abereid.com" target="_newbrowser">
Abe Reid</A> runs it... Alright some more real punk blues... <A Href="http://members.aol.com/chardietxx/index.html" target="_newbrowser">Simon and the Bar Sinisters</A>
 and <A Href="http://www.popachubby.com/" target="_newbrowser">Popa Chubby</A>
are a couple other cats doin' it. These guys are real versed in traditional blues, but have an honest,
passionate, raw take on it. Some of the <A Href="http://www.mutiny.com/thunders_home.htm" target="_Newbrowser">Johnny Thunders</A>
 acoustic shit has that sound too. Really, punk is blues
so punk/blues is a redundancy. We're punks and we get the blues (or some off-white version of it) and we 
fuckin' play music. But what started out as a musically versatile 'punk scene' in the 
seventies and eighties with bands as musically varient as Black Flag, The Minute Men, The Misfits,
maybe The Damned... well I wasn't there, but these bands all sound totally fuckin' different from each other.
It turned into this thing where everybody sounds like the fuckin' sex pistols, and that's what people think of 
as 'punk music'.<P>
So we who play contemporary music following a folk or blues tradition, we play for our people (not coca-cola).
We play blues or folk music that offends traditionalists (sorry to disturb your fuckin' coffin, count),
we might call it punk/blues or antifolk.<P>
Sold one CD at an open mic tonight in Richmond to this cool fifty-something year old physicist from Boston.
Tellin' him, "Yea, sometimes I worry, ya know? Getting old so fast, afraid I'll die unknown.".<BR>
He's like, "Even the 'knowns' are unknown in twenty years. Forget about being known.".<BR>
We discussed passionate underground artists from the past who no-one on this earth could name today, and how they're
alive tonight in the form of me and him - WE ARE THEM.<P>
Can you dig being part of something which spans generations and is greater than history or money or
any man-made thing within life, because it's one with life itself?<P>
Cyber Punk 'Snot Dead! The Egyptian ahnk is a depiction of a sandal, can you see it? It symbolizes eternal life - 
movement. Process. Imperfection is divine. Perfection is completion. Completion is entropy, collapse, 
the end. Death is revitalizing. At th end of the day, all you have is your integrity. If you've followed your dream,
and lived with a faith... <P>
The youngest of 21 children fucks rich men so she can raise a junkie daughter. An elderly woman with altzheimers
asks daily of the nursing home attendant "I'd like to pay my bill now.". Another finishes eating and inquires, 
"When will lunch be ready?" "Do you feel hungry?" "No." "That's because you just ate".<P>
Here's a wild one, and old woman had been living alone for a long time, showed up at the hospital,
and there were mice living in the rotting flesh beneath her armpits, where skin had grown in beneath the rib cage.<BR>
Sweet dreams.<P>
