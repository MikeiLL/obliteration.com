<FONT SIZE="+2">Okay okay okay. This freaky girl Caryn's been tryina get me naked with a hard-on and shit. I mean,
if I was single, yo. But it's so great to have my supa-fly all over it gorgeous, wet, soft WHAOOOOOOMAN
back home, she packed all this herbal tea and laundry detergent and grains, labeled 'em with a <I>sharpie</i>
marker like, how to cook it 'n' shit. Makes my heart flutter.<P>
So this gay Thai cook from Austin may be flying out to Atlanta tomorrow to catch a couple of shows and hang out.

If you're ever in Austin, go to Thai Passion, tell him Mike iLL sent you. It's on Seventh and Congress (or just off Congress). Homeboy feeds lunch to all these starving artists
around there, I mean a lot. Never seen anything quite like it.<P>
What else? Been performing live on all these College radio shows, like one a day for the last three days. 
It's really fun, these kids are cool as shit. It's fucked up though, 'cause half of 'em won't be there next year, so 
you always have to be developing new relationships.<P>
Oh man, this one show in Clarksdale MS was fuckin' funny as hell. I pretty much got boo'ed off the stage 
for the second show. It was an all black audience except for Caryn from Memphis (the horny dog) with two of 
her friends. The BETcomedy jam. This one dude, Shawn Jones was funny as hell. Anyway, I did pretty
good on the first show (tought crowd too, the guy after me got totally boo'ed off), they thought I was crazy.<P>
Second show started of pretty good, I yelled "NIGGERS" and ran out the back door. Came back, and I think
I was trying to hard, could've been more relaxed but I wanted so baad for these people to like it. I mean, a lot of 'em really did
but black people don't fuck around. I was sposed to play two songs, did "Can't Quite Gte The Blues" (which is un-finished),
"Your Man (Again)" and 1/2 of "Serial Wigger".<P>
Afterwards a lot of people said they liked it, the club owner and other comedians especially. The owner, Marco
who was in Sir Mix-A-Lot's band thinks the more nuts I go the better. He'slike "when you ran out that door: they loved
that". Big Shirl and Shawn got on the mailing list and shit. Shawnwas funny as hell, he totaly turned this crowd around.<P>
God, this one audience member, Rene was so funny. She's this big-ass woman, who sat up front (pretty much on the stage)
for the whole showwith a fuckin' running comentary. I had done the "Mousie Tale" in the first set, and she's all
"I don't wana hear no songs about rats".<P>
Thought she hated me, but at the end of the night, she was all askin for a sticker and was I commin' back tomorrow.
The wigga you love to hate.<P>
Yo, mad props and shoutouts to Caryn Loveless Hill, HairyApes BMX, Big Ass Truck and Glitch. Plus, 
Tim in El Dorado,  
KTCU, WLJS, WVUA and WEGL. Wildman Steve's, Last Chance, Sangri La and Vinyl Solutions.<P>
Oh yea, had to stop smoking again yesterday, no, two mornings ago. That shit kills me, fuckin' gettin' in there
like an octopuss and shit, suckin' you dry parisitic style.<P>
Dig the KRS-One song, "Health, Wealth and Self".
