<FONT SIZE="+4">All this stuff. Stuff stuff stuff stuff stuff.</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="+2"><TT>Throat hurts from smokin' the clove cigarettes that 
distract me from the pain in my throat. Hustlin' and scheemin' to make this next release happen. A book,
CD and CD-ROM. Plus to get sponsors for the tour. Got this fly van from sis and bro-in-law; still owe like 
half the payment. Everything's fuckin' rushed. Got to let go. The only thing I have to do is die.<P>
My songwriting is too square. Like, four lines with stupid simple rhyme schemes. Got to have the disciplin
to let 'em flow. That's the hardest fuckin' part. I always wanna put a corner on it right away. Controll
freak.<P>
Got distribution for "Seduction..." and a publisher for "Antifolk Road Manual". The publisher also released
books by this cat William Upski Wimsatt. He's got two books out that you absolutely gotta read; <U>Bomb the Suburbs</U>
and <U>No More Prisons</U>. Get 'em from <A Href=://www.softskull.com>www.softskull.com</A> for like ten bucks each.
If you're at all into racial-social-political issues, or underground media and activism, you'll be so fuckin' 
glad you did. And if you're into Hip-Hop, it's almost a must.<P>
