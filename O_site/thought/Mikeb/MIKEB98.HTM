<FONT SIZE="+2"><TT>What an interesting few weeks. Learned a ton of fucking computer programs I'd hardly heard of before.
Let's see... Had this idea to make a book with a CD in the back of it, cool. Got these two lo-fi videos, should be pretty easy to put them on the shit too.<P>
Every little step of the way's been a brick wall. We've burned through so many fuckin' discs it's insane. Cousin Chris and his partner Patric captured and crunched the videos and I did an HTML interface. My man Scott Anthony mastered the record on his PC, and we realized the videos were too big to fit. So then Rivkas boy Kevin said he'd make a Director interface (much more elegant than HTML) and re-crunch the videos. OK. So I bring them out to his place in the suburbs and back to get 'em the next day. Then Scott and I get together to burn the master. That's when we learned that you can't make a cross platform CD on a PC, you need to do it on a Mac. At one point (around 1:00 AM) Scott threw a disc accross the room and it broke in half. I said "look, you got it partitioned". Ha ha. So Kevin says he'll do it on the Mac.<P>
We spend a night where he works, very cool old building where supposedly Thomas Edison used to hang out.
We get stuff on the disc, but it puts a blank audio track at the beginning of the audio CD; can't have that. So we're searching all over the help pages of different software and search engines on the internet 'till like 3:00 AM one morning and next thing I remember I'm back at my cousin's the next day continuing to search the net.<P>
Seems there's a very specific format for what they call and Enhanced CD (or CD Extra), and Apple makes this free program that outputs it for you. Only problem is the program was discontinued in 1996 and we can't find it anywhere, but there's this new company that puts out a program called iShell that took over where Apple left off. So I get kicked out of there (these guys sleep) and drive back out to Kevin that night with the (free download) installer for iShell. We open that thing up, and search the companies web site, but don't see anything about Enhanced CD's or this QuAC file you need to output.<P>
So we're searching all over the Alta-vista search engine (my favorite) and Yahoo and Infoseek tryina find out about this QuAC or CD Extra thing. We find a few companies that'll do it for you (for like $1500.00), but nothing about how to do it. Then at about 2:30 in the morning on page seven of an Alta-vista search I see a posting about this old Apple program, Apple Interactive Music Toolkit, and it's got a fuckin' link to download it from some personal homepage at xoom.com. So we download and install it, and put in all this wierd information (like, you have to have an "album cover image" in there) and export (or save as or something) a QuAC file.<P>
So we're good to go, we burn the CD and bla bla bla and leave by 3:30 AM. Now I gotta get this fuckin' thing done 'cause I leave on tour in less than three weeks, and not having the record is gonna pretty much suck. As it is, radio won't have it nearly in time... that's just a joke. But guess what? Just a small thing. The readme.txt file on the PC side is all fucked up 'cause we opened it on the Mac before burning and it's all jumbled and full of black squares.<P>
O.K. so next night Kevin burns a new one and brings it down to Hoboken. I get the CD label art together and am about to mail it to the manufacturer when I notice that the audio portion has clicks on it and spaces between songs where there ain't s'posed to be and shit. I think 'cause we used the CD audio instead of the wave files Scott gave us. OK. I'll go to Doris' tonight and re-burn it with the wav files.<P>
No. The Toast CD burning software doesn't like wave files, you need aiff files. So I get on a hackers FTP site to see about finding software to convert from wave to aiff files. Download Peak and Jam neither of which work. Here's one called WaveConvert. Download it and open it up, but it won't let me convert, becuase I don't have a serial number. OK. Go back on the hackers ftp site to get hackers helper program... Nope. Can't log on, too many users, try again later. OK got it. Here's a serial number. Fuck, it's for the wrong version of the program and won't work.<P>
Finally found a program called ConvertMachine that does it. It's slow as a motherfucker on this machine. We'll see if it works. Five-fifty-eight A.M. now and only one of 20 files converted. They seem to take about 20 minutes each. Guess Doris'll be in wanting to use her machine about nine. Rivka wakes up in half an hour to go work at the coffee store. Guess I'm a little tired. Oh look. This ain't goin as slow as I thought. I'll put this page up, go see Rivka and maybe go with her to work and get some chai and come back here. If the thing still ain't workin' i'll just send the CD artwork so homeboy can make photo's of that (which takes a coupla days anyway), and mail the audio hopefully Saturday or Monday.<P>
Oh yea. Meanwhile the print aspects of this book have been equally daunting. Most recent snags being that we used all these TrueType fonts in the document and had to find substitute PostScript fonts and that Erin's (who is helping design the book) Cd burner is all fucked up.<P>
So, as Kevin put it, "Welcome to the world of multi-media."
