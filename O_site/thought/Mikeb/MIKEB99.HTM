<FONT SIZE="+2"><TT>Happy Spring<P>
Wow. Has it really been 4 weeks since I last wrote? What a nutty time. Finally got the book/CD
out hours before leaving on this 8 week tour. Was late for a show in Philly the first date and didn't 
get paid; it was still fun. Shows in Richmond and Ashville were very cool. Both great cities.<P>
Today I'm in Huntsville, Alabama. This town doesn't have shit going on as far as an alternative scene.
Played a blues jam last night in a coffee house. It's run by a very talented and cool guitarist named Jim
Cavender. Everybody doing these fuckin' played out cover songs and I got kinda depressed. Went to sleep
in the van at like 12:30 A.M. and dreamed about crying with my father over abortions he read about in
my book. Don't know if he's read the stuff yet, but as far as I know he doesn't know... Do know that he thinks
of it as loosing grandchildren.<P>
At a Kinko's now. Been here for like 4 hours making phone calls and mailing shit out. Inside the van looks like
a slight war zone... shit everywhere. I got to put sponsors logo.s up on the web site. Everything's always
so chaotic and out of control. Must eat.<P>
I'm so blessed to be able to travel and play. It's been rainy and I feel lonely in this town - military.
Tried to call my love but our phone's disconnected. Do we have enough to pay the bill?<P>
Stopped smoking. Ain't even smoked herb in almost a week. Last Tuesday got so stoned before performing in New York
the show was fuckin' terrible. I'm lookin' at all my friends thinkin' "They're just paying dues, supporting."
<P>Why is this country so conservative. People are so scared of the fuckin' truth. What's so wrong
about sexuality? It is the cause of our existence.<P>
Grey day.
