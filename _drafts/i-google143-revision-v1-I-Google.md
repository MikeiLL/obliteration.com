Sometimes think about informational garbage and the game of spam.
Ever imagine that an artists Hell is to be subjected to their creations for eternity?
So what of the spammer? Residence in a library of novels composed of their life's output.

Check out the <a title="Internet Spam WIkipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history of internet spam</a>. It's named for the canned meat, by way of a <a title="Spam (Monty Python)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28Monty_Python%29">Monty Python sketch</a> in which Spam is included in almost every dish.

Not only e-mail, but now the web is abso-fuckin-lutely flooded with meaningless copies of bullshit fake information put there for nothing more than to game the information organizers, who are profit-based corporations anyway.

Somebody once said, "Ain't nothin' outside of the Bible worth reading 'cause if it's not in the Bible it ain't true an' if it's true it's already in the Bible anyway."

Will today's great novel be keyword-loaded? It's a matter of the bull-shit to value ratio.

Google is a fitting name.
