Seeing a fool and judging a fool are two different things. It takes one to know one. We take commitment lightly and discard our chance to fulfill "'till death", not realizing the commitment was actually to ourselves and not the other. Life's end comes sooner than we think and it ends up being today that we die. Will your next vows include, "and this time I mean it"?
Exotic cars and rock star shades offer nothing. Isn't one extra asshole enough? The economic hamster wheel doesn't help. And don't pretend half-hearted gestures are determination. Walk away now and you are unchanged. Survive the crucible and the heroes journey advances. May decisions be guided by wisdom and devotion, powered by courage. The seeking of ones own fulfillment leads elsewhere. It' a miracle any marriage survives. They're not natural. Here's hope for yet another failing relationship.
