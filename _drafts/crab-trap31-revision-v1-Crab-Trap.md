Our friends Margo and Bill live in a Dome house on the Bay (actually it's nearly a complete globe, as the stilts complete a circle), and Bill recently pulled some old crab traps out of the water.

We were checking them out yesterday and they are really simple. The crabs crawl in to get some food and could easily leave through the entrance, but they are incapable of seeing it.

I was so taken by the concept that I lost track of time, missed a credit card payment and my APR went up to 29%.

Stupid crabs.
