Ken Holman (Mr. Imagine), who had set our hive up, came over a couple of days ago with a large cereal box all duct-taped up saying, "Guess what I found? Some more bees and larvae in a moray hive I'd given up for dead."

We opened our disheartened, confused and decaying hive up, removed a bunch of the old comb, smashed a ton of hive beetles and drown a bunch more in a pan of soapy water (just like Rivka does with the fleas). The put the old comb (some full of honey - well, maybe we harvested some of that) in the freezer to kill off any infesting beetle larvae.

Ken goes, "Call Morgan and see if you can get a new Queen." Aunt Anne also recommended that it's not too late in the year
