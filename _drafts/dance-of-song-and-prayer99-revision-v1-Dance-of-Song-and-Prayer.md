A fervent Pentecostal I occasionally run into in he neighborhood told me that she had wanted some assurance about life after death so she prayed to Yeshua and Yeshua answered and so now she worships Yeshua. Next time I see her I will tell her that I prayed to no one and no one answered to now I pray to no one. Daily and with great passion.
