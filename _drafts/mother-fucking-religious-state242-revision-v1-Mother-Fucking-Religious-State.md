The notion that the self-sacrifice of the people in Gaza is due to an inherent cultural philosophy, as opposed to a reaction to extreme inhumane treatment is as racist as the notion that blacks and Latinos have an inherent tendency toward crime - rather than the statistics exemplifying the economic disparity under which we all live.

All of the world's most popular religions and certainly the Christian, Jewish and Muslim philosophies romanticize martyrdom and the importance of the after-life over the physical life. So PLEASE stop pretending there is any US and THEM in this situation. There are profiteers, gangsters and killers capitalizing on the potential for violence on both sides, but the US is actually financing the ones on the stronger side.

And if a Jewish State can only be sustained through violence and humiliation, is it really necessary? And that goes for any Christian, Muslim or Money-worshiping state as well. If women and homosexuals are being treated unjustly in one part of the world, let us help them by treating our own women and "minorities" as equals - not by bombing the fuck out of them.
