Started streaming weekly on Twitch.tv a few weeks ago. Guided by Rosuav.

The potentially cancerous neck/ear/throat discomfort continues.

Have an appointment with Dr White on the 30th.

Not tired but not really rested.

It's 11pm now. Coding begins at 8am.

Things got really sketchy with client project and colleague the last ten days or so, but are tentatively stable again. A check has arrived and the client is cautiously optimistic. It's a cool project. WebSockets and the Pike language. Rosuav is brilliant. A great artist.

Leonard Peltier now in his eighties was pardoned finally by the outgoing president. Biden.

Trump was inaugurated today. Four years or perhaps an eternity.
