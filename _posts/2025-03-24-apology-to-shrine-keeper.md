Hello builder and keeper of this sacred space.

I apologize for my display of arrogance when I met you on the train tracks yesterday (or so).

I wish I had just said thank you.

I'm going through (well, being me and) cancer treatment right now (stage 1 with radiation and chemo it is statistically unlikely to be fatal) and using thc to manage pain, which has a pretty potent effect on my perception.

The overlook atop the shrine/sanctuary/your space always calls to me on a circular walk from our home on Jackson and W street and this past Saturday (the equinox I think) I finally allowed myself to walk over and and at first sight of the peaks of the two east and west christmas trees, then the pink flower, was just continually filled with feeling blessed, laughing, moved, humbled, pacified:

the water, the slide, the nude beach, the heart-wrenching love story; 4:20 clock, buddha face, risk advisors.

I could go on and on  (already have to a few loved ones). It is as I imagine you know very well so life-affirming and inspiring an effort, which shows such courage and depth of suffering and transformation.

So again: Thank you.

I would gladly kiss (or wash or massage) your feet as an expression of respect for the great work and gift.

Sincerely,

Mike iLL Kilmer
