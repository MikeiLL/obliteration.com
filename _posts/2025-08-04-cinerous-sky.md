Cinerous is our background color today like the Pensacola sky. `#b7b7b7`.

We continue to watch the Gaza genocide from a frustrated distance. Trump and the Israeli elite soliloquize a new Riviera. Fucking pigs.

They can keep the orgies. Abstinance sounds like a plan. Asexuality, please.

Gender deletion surgery.

Suck my cinerous heart waves from the top of the gallows from the guillotine bed.

And how would you like your poor to eat and will you plan on listening to the old music for ever, eating the old food from your palatial martian compounds.

We'll vascillate between dying and ghostly until we come back as rocks and roaches.

I embrace it.

Not really.

Cynical much.
