Ego melting didn't happen perhaps because the DMT unit wasn't charged. Been fearing it both because ego melt if scary and 'cause Peter Shark says it is extremely toxic.

Just buried an unfamiliar cat in the front yard. Had to cut through the web of vine, bramble and grass roots to make the hole. Mostly white with orange around the tail. Zahir didn't recognize either.

It had been there earlier. Someone probably tossed it off the road.

Picked up twenty five three hundred fifty milligram oxycodones from Walgreens. Learned the kid behind the pharmacy counter the one with the philipino bleached bouffant is also a m√∫sico. Opera and musical theatre.

Couldn't help but smile learning that Dr White had prescribed the good stuff. Desiring and fearing it.

The two books from the Inter-Library Lending system came in. ILL they call it. So that's what iLL stands for! Chasing Acker by Chris Kraus begins by describing Kathys final months denying and dying of cancer. The book has only been checked out once before. In twenty eighteen. On my birthday. Apparently Kathy was fifty when she died. In Mexico. The book cover is red. The checkout stamp is red. My first word was red. These are the ravings of an ego-centric narcissistic cancer-having (near-definitely) human (supposedly).

Our co-pays for this weeks procedures, the PET scan and ultrasound guided needle biopsy are twenty-five hundred dollars. Gulp.

Ben Jackson arrives in thirty for his piano/drum lesson.

Looking forward to Sunday and singing our new hymn Remember Me. Also a bit anxious about seeing Robin R who is perhaps also triggered by my presence. Not sure. No idea. We don't speak.
