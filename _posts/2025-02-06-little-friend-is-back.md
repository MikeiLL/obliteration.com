Emilio says Ram Das refers to disease as your little friend.

Guide. Angel.

Two centimeters is over half an inch.

Suspicios is a word Hilliary White used, ordering a needle biopsy and a PET scan.

The pet scan is the one where they inject you with radioactive sugar, give it an hour to spread about and then put the million dollar machine to spinning around you.

Maybe it's a half a million. Maybe two.

Existential pondering of course.

Some elements of self blame. Guilt.

It's because I'm an arrogant selfish sinner.

It's because I didn't continue high intensity interval training.

Should have been drinking the chinese herbs.

The bullshit of the mind.

Iya Osunfemi says Elegba reports that it's a low stage cancer and should be simple to treat.

Following the biopsy Dr. White may want to remove the remaining tonsil so that it can be sliced up and studied.

Polite agressive phone activity seems to be moving the test schedule along.

The fire in the neck head slowly increases in temperature and would theoretically overwhelm without treatment.

Iya says Elegba says I'm still on the road of my destiny.

What more could any of us want than to be following our destiny?

Well, iLL.
