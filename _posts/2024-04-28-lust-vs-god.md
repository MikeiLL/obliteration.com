Books sitting in the AbeBooks.com shopping cart, awaiting our budget: Simone De Beauvoir's The Second Sex, Deviations by Gayle Rubin and from Judith Butler the seminal Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (Thinking Gender Series) which came out in the 1990's and we are just beginning to catch on.

Claim a masculine identity in this world? No thanks.

Joe Glass was a good man. Montgomery, Alabama to Hoboken. He once said he loved cleaning toilets because it's so simple. When it's clean, you're done. Great man. Another short life.

So what about cock and pussy? When you are meditating on the big vein with your tongue and every distraction isn't, God's there, right? Like right there with you?

There's an idea of frictionless intercourse. The Karezza method. Slow and prayerful. Rivka so far has no interest of patience for this. Kathy Acker, by the way, agrees with Rikki that sixty-nine is simply two people distracted from a task which should be concentrated.

There's hunger and the greedy animalistic aspect of sexual desire. Is that something to overcome. What is definitely not useful is the aspect where the goal and very frequently in men here the goal is visually stimulated and primarily to exorcise and overcome the sexual urgency. Then we're done. No significant communication occurred.

Ice cube in the pussy. That was a thing with T back in our twenties. An idea from a book maybe.

Sometimes to some degree I'm able to enjoy the inner sexual energy regardless of any external stimulation. These are still challenges.

The desire to sniff and stare at sex. Perhaps it is a displaced or misdirected desire to reunite with some more elusive thing. Then again perhaps it is actually a reminder that the undescribable thing is here with us always within without above beneath and around.

All praises to the one who does not exist. There is no god there is no god there is no god but Wow.
