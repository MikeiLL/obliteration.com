Today is the Festival of Nickolas, an aspect of Odin, leader of the Hunt, who rides the heavens on a chariot drawn by raindeer. In gnostic tradition it is a day to attain a higher spiritual dimention through frequent sex.

Friday my woman and I went to a kabbalistic synagogue on 85th street in New York. The eighty-something year old Rabbi seems very joyous. The Kabballa is an ancient method of spiritual enlightenment tied in with a glyph called the [Tree of Life](http://www.io.com/~khabir/tree.html).

Then we went home and had "our first clitoral orgasm". "This is a very important time", she goes.
