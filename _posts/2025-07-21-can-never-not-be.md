> That which is not can never be and that which is can never not be <cite>Bhagavad Gita</cite>

And Jeff wonders <q>How do you feel like it frees you in day to day life pondering that?</q>

Individual freedom doesn't exist in the scope of the day but in the scope of the moment.

In the scope of the breath.

And that phrase that concept itself well the freedom comes as a result of using it to guide the awareness deeper into the self that can never not be further liberated from the self that can never be.

In relation to Ishvara Pranidhana (surrendering to the divine) the freedom is not freedom of choice it is freedom from choice. It is not doing what we think god wants it is living in intuition and acting courageously acting accordingly. Take out the mind the manas the middle-man the old croney who's so adept at logic and so completely out of touch with emotion. So good at holding <q>That which is not can never not be</q> and so on but also the reason we need to be reminded of it.

Penis didn't want to help me masturbate last night. Didn't want to fantasize or use libricant aids. Did a few pushups and fell back to sleep in the hot bedroom. Woke up too early if eight hours sleep really is a requirement as the oncologists keep saying. How I can pull this schedule back where I want it to get more morning before the hundred degreeses arrive.
