They are going to double the dosage and frequency of his chemotherapy which is expected to double the side effects.

He's started writing as he describes it bad poetry: hope breeds expectation.

Wants to serve to provide for his family. His clients with the alien personalities of wealth they insist on deadlines for the renovated kitchen of a third home.
