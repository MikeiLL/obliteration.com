Starts with n, ends with r and has igge in the middle.

It's a word that is used liberally in one of these entries dated around twenty years ago.

A story about playing a gig where a song by the Last Poets describes being "scared of revolution", and someone being insulted. At the time, I stopped the song and tried to explain myself. Hindsight, though, why didn't I apologize?

Don't really expect that word to lose its insensitivity any time soon. Even discussing it feels dangerous.

That, sadly, is more about fear of being embarrassed than of triggering someone or making them feel disrespected and/or inferior.

The public humiliation in the stocks of the world wide web. Look what this idiot did. Walk in fear of becoming famous for an ignorant statement, perhaps made in the process of an evolving comprehension. Perhaps in a state of high anxiety.

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Apparently it's a word frequently borrowed to other languages because there isn't another one like it.

It's a good inelegant non-eloquent piece of language. Try it in any grammatical context.

Jenny fuck going to the store.

Marty is fucking to the store.

Mario is going fuck the store.

Gustav is going to fuck store.

Zadie is going to the fuck.

And of course Fuck is going...

There isn't an unpunishable piece in here.
