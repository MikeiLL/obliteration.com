You're reading this because at least one of our insomnia.

Hopefully not yours.

Get up. Notice the clock. It's been an hour. Again. Another hour.

Circadian funk.

The little dog down the block yaps.

The loud whisper of tires on pavement.

Gurgling hum of a passing motor.

The pushup trick, perhaps. Tire out the body.

Yes.

Wishing us luck.
