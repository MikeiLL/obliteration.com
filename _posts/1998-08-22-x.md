| Zues hangs on the tree of life; learns the secrets of the runes.
illness plays CBGB's at 1:00 AM - Zef Noi$E in full effect; multi-violinguistic.
Beastie Boys video Intergalactic; so fly on our TV.
US govt. drops bombs on Pakistan by mistake while we talk about a blow job. Makes me iLL.
If they're against 'us' they're terrorists, on our side its 'freedom fighters'. See more doublespeak
than a broken radio.
The moon is Black tonight, like the goddess Kali (Birth, and Destruction). |


 **Peace, Mike iLL**
