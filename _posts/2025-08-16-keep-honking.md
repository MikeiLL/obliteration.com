Too many do-you-ever-wonder too many do-you-ever-feel-like

and for that matter too many too-many lyrics, stanzas, lines in this language.

Picking Rinah up from work at the end of the baseball game the other night that feeling of not being from the same planet as these thousands of people.

Wondering if it's a matter of an out of control ego, of solopsism. Neurodivergent a popular descriptor.

There's a great bumper sticker Hope my libertarian buddy from the Palafox market has on the back the truck that takes her on and off the grid which might lift your spirits.

It goes like this:

> Keep honking. I also am a goose who is pretending to be human. Fear not comrade are day will come.

How awesome is that?
