Hard to read?

This is how clear who's right and who's wrong in this marriage.

Narcissism. Abuse? BPD? Skipped medication.

It all comes out. Lightening from the eyes.

Acid from the mouth.

A litany of crimes.

We remember things differently.

One of us must be lying.

You ruin my friendships is said.

Everyone knows you didn't support me.

Haven't shared a blanket in weeks.

There's a hurricane a state or two east.

Otter says it's raining sideways through the windows.

We survive these dips into abysses. We ponder the rafters though.

Some people's children use them as exits.

Which would make this look like ice cream.

Prayers welcome...

Ish.

â€“sIllt.
