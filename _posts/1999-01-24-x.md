This goes out to all the hackers, cypher punks, digit addicts, number crunchers, information infatuates, long-distance hustlers, midnite serial number crackers, chat heads, masochists and frankensteins.
Fear I'll be in the way. Ego is the monster says "I can't, I won't, I'll never."
Oh to ignore my unreal shadow self. To fight back the monster which feasts on pride and shame.
To face each moment without self consciousness. To see my companions strengths as my own, and my weaknesses as
decisions I don't have to make. To do what needs to be done, and fuck what the shallow parts think it wants.

 Please, Mike iLL
