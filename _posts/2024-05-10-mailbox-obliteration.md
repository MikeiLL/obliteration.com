Certainly very high on something or a combination more likely all those years ago and certainly very much older than eighteen Billy G, Taps, Pervis, Latch, Zef and I thought it made a lot of sense to amuse ourselves one night driving around blowing up residential mailboxes with M80s.

M80s are the big fire crackers that could blow off your fingers. Nobody lost any limbs that night but a few strangers lost their mailboxes.

Well. Karma is a funny thing.

Really. Laughing all the way to the hardware store.
