| Wow, what a beautiful day. The warm sun shines down on all of us.
 Met the coolest bunch 
of people at an open mic down here in Huntsville, AL. Racially mixed (all too rare), funny, honest, freaky,
young and unique. My man Tony's wearing a black old-school style hat, smokin' a 14" home-modified pipe and 
wearin' a black rock 'n' roll T-shirt. These kids play the wildest style of punky folk-rock including 
Monty Python songs.
Know that one "Alwaus Look on the Bright Side"? So fuckin' funny and they have the best fun lovin' attitude.
There's hope for Huntsville after all.
Great day.
