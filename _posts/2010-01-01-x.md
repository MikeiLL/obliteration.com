| Anubis, jackle-headed Thelemic god of the dead, weighs your heart versus a feather. Imagine a light-hearted death. Not only unburdened by anger, guilt, resentment and jealousy, but lifted by the buoyancy of compassion, joy and humor.
"No Anubis, that's not my heart that sent the feather flying into the stratosphere, it's just the old rusty fishing weights tangled up in it." The devil, fishing for sinners. |

















Mucho Amor.
