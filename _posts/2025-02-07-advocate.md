The hospital says the next ultrasound guided biopsy is not until the 19th. Twelve days away.

They say you can, "call every day and see if there are cancellations... we don't have a waiting list".

Sounds like fun. Perhaps calling once an hour even. Will soon have the hold music memorized.

Poking around for other places that can offer the service.

In the meantime the mostly tolerable pain continues, slowly increasing.

Look around at sloppy grimy gluttonous addicts and wonder why they don't have cancer.

Time to eat something, unless there's a deep hole around here to crawl into for a while.

Okay maybe a hot bath.
