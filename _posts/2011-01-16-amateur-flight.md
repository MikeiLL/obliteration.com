Sitting in Pensacola Airport, gate Three (out of like, twelve) with a "buddy pass", which is a stand-by ticket. In other words if there's an empty seat on the flight, you get on. Apparently this one's booked solid, so hopefully someone will flake.

Buying this ticket has been an ordeal. All our credit cards were maxed out, but we have an account with this company, "Bill Me Later", then there was a new credit card and balance transfer, which went awry. Long story short, there were nearly half a dozen attempts to buy round trip tickets, one of which had gotten as far as my putting a reservation number in my calendar, which scared the fuck out of me this morning, thinking a broke-ass mother-fucker bought two sets of tickets for the same trip.

Seems not to've been the case, by the grace of Goddess.
