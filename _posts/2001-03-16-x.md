Whaaaaaat the motherfuckin' fuck and shit and aaaaaye? How many life-times since these pages have seen an update? There's a couple of journal entries on [Mike iLL.com](http://www.mikeill.com target=_newbrowser), but I'm not feelin' the way they come out listed, and I probably should've learned my lesson about doing shit yourself.

Like, Bar/None Records (did I mention my new band Mad Happy, with Rivka, Nelson Pla and Crag, and that we got a record deal?) has hired the Beastie Boys publicity company to hype up our current tour. It's been over three weeks and I haven't seen a fuckin' thing. And this is in places like Little Rock and Memphis where I know I could've gotten something in the local free weekly. Of course the hope is that it's only been three weeks set-up time and over the next couple of months things will pick up.

The guys at "Nasty" definitely seem quite cool. Turned me on to this new cat [Andrew W.K.](http://www.andrewwk.com), who I'm not sure if I love or hate, but that alone says a lot. 'Cause most of what I hear I could give two fucks about.

We have played with two really cool bands on this tour, [Complete Strangers](http://www.geocities.com/CompleteStrangers) out of Huntington, WV, who sound like something between Iggy Pop, James Brown and the Ramones, and a bad-ass punk blues band out of Athens, OH called [Geraldine](http://ubl.artistdirect.com/music/artist/card/0,,523476,00.html). These guys weren't the only two bands, but definitely our over-all favorites.

So listen, look for a new Mike iLL diary entry soon. And please go to your local music store and BUY OUR CD. Mad Happy - Feel Good Music... for the Broke Middle Class.

  Love,
