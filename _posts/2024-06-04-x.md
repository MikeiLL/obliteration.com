Habitat came in, or paid someone to come in and install two mini-split HVAC units with an outside condenser that can support a third.

The tattood ex-meth chef who'd been out of jail six years that headed the install team was lovely.

Because of the installation process the main room of the house, which includes eat in kitchen, pantry living room piano room den is filled with decommissioned shelves and their contents and a four by eight by two foot bookcase on its side.

We are reorganizing before Ashirah's 12th birthday party this Saturday which will have a Hello Kitty theme. The child of a couple of local socialist activists we like a lot is coming over for the first time.

It's June in Pensacola so none of us is wearing much in the way of clothing. Rivka pulls open their black panties from the waist and reaches in wondering, "am I sweating or am I leaking?", and then in a theatrically weary voice with a creak in it utters, "probably leaking" on the way to the bathroom.

Party supply shopping took two hours. BJs is using a deal on gasoline to sell TVs.

For Charlotte's funeral tomorrow the final song selection is Leonard Cohen Halleluja instrumental, Here Comes the Sun, 'Tis a Gift to be Simple and Amazing Grace along with some music before and after the service and fifteen minutes for a slideshow. Hopefully we'll be able to see the slides and Thom Botsford (sax) and I play.
