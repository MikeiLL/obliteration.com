Ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe. The light I never knowed. Ain't no use I'm on the dark side of the road. And I wish there was something you would do or say to try and make me stay. Goodbye is too good a word so I just say fare thee well. Don't think twice etc...

The light well fuck I lean over his penis head turned to the side licking up the big vein and back down to the garden of curly black hair. My shins pin his arms his longing tongue stretches his neck toward God's manifestation but I make him wait.

Radiation begins at 3pm Tuesday. Tomorrow Dr. Patel will recommend Cisplaten as well: a radio-activator. Hit it with everything Nancy LaNasa suggests. Should be fun.

At Zahir's shop this week accepting payments and telling people what the cars cost. Since Orange Man and his bosses took office the latino clients can no longer register cars.

Do not annoy your wife with pathetic needy childish whiney horniness and small dick anxieties. Write your god cock a love letter. Hip swing some loving blood in there.

Helen is driving Rikki to Dr Viglione's tomorrow. You rock Helen. Another brilliant librarian we get to be friends with. Teachers and librarians.

At Zahir's this month. Tomorrow is Carrie's birthday. She dates a cat named Jason now with a big dog and a lot of drive.

Miss mom who sits quietly in the memory care unit in New Jersey mostly ignoring her piano. Divorces galore among siblings. Distant past, recent past, current and future. It's a fucking mess.

And Teresa's dead: we don't know what that even means.

Francesca bitchuates it is 10PM and we said we were going to bed early which this is not these days.

So there's that. Good night.
