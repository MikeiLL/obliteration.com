One: Ian Freakin' B thank you for the reminders about Discordianism and [E-Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime) which was only a vague memory.

Two: Perry Robinson thank you for the book <u>Eunoia</u> and the awareness of [Christian BÃ¶k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_B%C3%B6k) what a bug out:

> Mermen help these helmsmen berth the wrecked vessels; then the Greek crews erect well-defended shelters wherever&hellip;

Three: The series with the quote:

> Why are there shape-shifting assassins from another dimension stealing frozen heads

[Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_Deferred) by JJ Abrams and others. We frequently try to recall that name of the series without success. Fringe.

In closing: since we all agree: E mother fucking prime. Wild.
