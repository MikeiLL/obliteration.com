Sometimes it seems like if all the white people left the planet those left behind would be better off.

Pondering Gaza birthed that thought tonight.

White people don't exist and never did of course.

But racism does so we acknowledge it.

English. The english language is ambiguous. It has fewer tenses than other languages.

Like if we say I'm coming, do we mean I _am_ coming or I am _going to be_ coming?

Two different tenses. There are tenses and there are moods. Maybe you already know this and perhaps you will be the only one to ever read this.

If you know someone is going to read something, you can't write outside of the prison of that knowledge, right?

How do you write something you plan to publish with the freedom that it may never be seen.

It's not a new question but is it wrong to write nigger shit jew fuck bitch rape asslick cancer curse satan christ when someone might read it?

Where does that sentence even span? Trauma? Damage? Indulgence?

I am coming is the present indicitave tense meaning currently. I am coming is not the future tense but we use it that way. In all likelyhood we _shall_ use it in that ambiguous way into the future, complaining that using they and them as singular pronouns doesn't work.

There are tenses and there are moods.

A midlife crisis of elementary mathematics and grammar. Why not?

Now if all the humans leave the planet, well... noone but our pets would complain.

Writers Dennis Cooper and Alain Robbe-Grillet of interest.
