| Tomorrow morning we leave for Richmond. It'll be Rivka and I
 in the 100 degree weather for two weeks plus. Alabama, Texas, Tennessee,
 the Carolinas... Crazy shit.
 Van's workin'. New York Antifolk, baby. It's nice to be part of a scnen,
 even if it's really only a phantom. I mean, what IS a scene really?
