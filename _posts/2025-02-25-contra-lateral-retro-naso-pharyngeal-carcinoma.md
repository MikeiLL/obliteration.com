Always feel optimistic leaving Dr White and those dreamy eyes.

You're tough. You're young. Chemotherapy will be a lot harder than just radiation but you'll get through it.

From back to front contralateral retro naso pharyngeal carcinoma is cancer in the nose part of the pharynx or throat behind the sinus cavity and on the opposite side (from the earlier cancer).

Cisplaten is the go-to chemotherapy which involves platinum. They might want to use something called 5FU which sounds more intense and involves carrying a machine around pumping it into you for four day stretches.

Trump is president or is it Elon Musk. They are open about wanting to turn Gaza into a vacation property.

Animalistic sex holding Rivka's bearded chin between my teeth oh that was a dream.

They will take my case before the Tumor Board where perhaps doctors put on black robes and judges wigs and in a dark room bang a gavel and pronounce prognoses.

Heaven is freedom from desire. Hell is longing for relief. Rivka says freedom from desire sounds more like depression than bliss. With no hope longing disintigrates and what is left is freedom from desire. So lose hope. Lose all hope always.
