This must be what it feels like to be a complaint.

I love them both. They had kids. Decade plus.

She stopped wanting to fuck.

They tried "polyamory", more like a marriage with one open side.

He doesn't want to miss out on the time his dick still works.

Now he's not the man she married.

He hates how she manages money.

The kids are resiliant.

He's remote.
