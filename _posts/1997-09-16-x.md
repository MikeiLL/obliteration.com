Welcome to New York where the party never stops. Princess Di has died young, reminding us that money can't buy everything.
 Here's a Kamitic prayre from 2000 B.C.

OH MY MOTHER NUT, DESCEND!
SPREAD TOURSELF UPON ME
SO THAT I MAY BE PLACED AMONGST THE EVERLASTING STARS
THAT ARE IN YOU

This woman called Fa told us it tripping on 'room's under the Kauai
stars. Fa is real close with Angelo from [Fishbone](http://ubl.com/artists/002052.html). What an amazing band.
 Yea, in-mothaf'n-sanity. Forget the vanity. Caffeine society. There's a methane fire in the psyche of the new dark ages.

Smoke seeps up from mental fault lines on pothole ridden city streets.

Satan rules by using Love not War.
**Stay iLL**
