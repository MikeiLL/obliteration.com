| Yo. I seen two cool bands last week, you should check out. This band ['Mindless Self Indulgence'](http://www.mindlessselfindulgence.com) was great; total CyberPunk shit.
Maybe it gets tired after a while, but on first dig I was blown away.

It's like elvis gets plugged into an electric outlet, turns bi-sexual and does gangsta rap in a techno style. Look out for 'em.

The other band I was feelin' was the opposite in ways. It's called Chocolate Genius [(V2 Records)](http://www.v2music.com), and it was like a soul/jazz type deal w/
Sim Cain (Rollins Band) on Drums, [Oren Bloedow](http://www.knittingfactory.com/CD_Catalogue/CD_List/Bloedow.html) on Bass and  [Mark Ribot](http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&q=%27Mark+Ribot%27&search=Search) on guitar.
Mark is a sick fuckin' guitarist man. All these cats are bad ass. Anyway, have a great surf and drink lots of tea this winter.

 Heal, Mike iLL
