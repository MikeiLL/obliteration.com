What do we got? NyQiLL last night was rather fly. There's some cat there who is supposedly friends with the president,
Bill Clinton? Oh shit, that's kind of *dope*. We played for a long time, dancing, singing, smokin', drinkin'.Personally I'm getting a bit tired of being stoned every night.
Discipline baby, discipline. I wanna get rich and have wives and babies and world wide travels with many languages. Buy mom a car. Buy Daddy a Pancreas.
Zef Noi$e is so phat on violin, it continues to blow my mind, and I've been listening to the mother since he's 7 years old.
Keep takin' us there homes. I swear we'll be dead someday.
Kill Audio continues to bust out new sick-next-level beats and shit.
 Benny Raw; Makin' em move.
 Here's a lyric emerged from the chaos (Jim "Radio" Rado):

```
                         Momalian Australian Stalion Alien
```

 Chanted fast . . . and YO. What????
 Oh yea, Fuckin' W.S Burrough's.
 I fuckin' love his work. Here's one:
"Unless writing has the danger and immediacy, the the urgency of bullfighting,
it is nowhere to my way of thinking... I am tired of sitting behind the lines with an imperfect recording device recieving
inaccurate bulletins...I must reach the front."
 W.S.B.
 And on that note. . . oh yea, the new hang on Tuesday night's: Open Mic.
at Maxwell's. Someone said something about "us clumsy seers". Can you dig that?
Can you dig opiated hash?
