| Cancelled another 5 shows today. Van ill be in the shop 'till monday, if we're lucky: cheap, honest, experienced mechanics are very busy.

As it turns out, this means we can make the rain date for the festival this weekend in Hoboken. Silver linings behind the storm clouds. As Rivka's brother Mendy said, "Break a mirror, you know you'll live seven more years."
Still no light at the end of the tunnel, but the eyes grow accustomed.

Rivka hooked up the great fully body massage, with hand release. An irredescent stone?
  still smiling.Se√±or iLL
