Learning about Surrealism and specifically Black Surrealism. Reading a book: <u>Black, Brown and Beige: Surrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora</u> by Franklin Rosemont and new crush Robin D.G. Kelley.

Have read so far about sixty out of four hundred pages, though, what is a page. Depends on the typography. Reading on this eReader which at the configured font size brings the whole length to around seven hundred "pages" and the progress to some percentage, thirteen or so.

The company who makes the eReader doesn't support export of annotations on sideloaded files (this one a generated ePub file from Archive.org). They say it's by design. They want you to buy books from them. They don't even carry this one.

Guess what. There is a database _in_ the device. When you plug it into the machine you can go into the database and export the annotations yourself. They're right there. Fuckers.

Here are a few of them:


> but other enemies of surrealism had ways of enforcing their bigotry. In Hitler's Germany, for example, surrealism in painting and poetry was reviled as degenerate art and officially forbidden, as it was in Franco's Spain and Hirohito's Japan.

***

> Significant, too, was Dumas’ Count of Monte Cristo. As a story of escape, struggle against injustice, and ultimate revenge, it has never been surpassed.

***

> The works of Alexandre Dumas were also important. Dumas is not only France's best-known author of African descent, but also France's best-known author, period.

***

***

> “Revolution Now and Forever!"

***

> In an early and too rarely discussed essay (“Distances," 142-147), Breton reflects on the problems artists have in bringing their work to the attention of the public. Highly critical of the fact that art had fallen “under the control of businessmen,” he goes on to denounce those “bad places” called “galleries.

> enthusiasm for the revolt of And El-Krim and the Rif tribespeople of Morocco in the summer of 1925.7 In a July 15 statement they declared their solidarity with the Riffians and affirmed “the right of peoples, of all peoples, of whatever race" to self-determination.

***

> Simone Yoyotte Léro was the organizer, but the entire Légitime Defense Group was remarkable. Simone Yoyotte, for example, was by all standards a strikingly original figure. Her poems,

> to liberate the unconscious, they practice hypnosis and dream interpretation as well as automatic writing and drawing. They have discovered new techniques, from frottage and collage to cubomania and prehensilhouette, and have invented games that result in collective poetry. “Drawing correspondences between our real and imaginative experiences” — in the words of poet and anthropologist Ayana Karanja—helps resolve the contradictions between dreaming and waking, subjective and objective."

***

> Hugo was an early source of the Surrealist Group's vehement opposition to white supremacy.

***

> THE TRIUMVIRATE OF NEGRITUDE AND LETUDIANT NOIR Sorcerer, release the dreams born here. —Anne Spencer

***

> surrealism does not signify unreality, antireality, the nonsensical, or the absurd. On the contrary, surrealism — an open realism — signifies more reality, and an expanded awareness of reality, including aspects and elements of the real that are ordinarily overlooked, dismissed, excluded, hidden, shunned, suppressed, ignored, forgotten, or otherwise neglected.

> Wherever western civilization is dominant, all human contact has disappeared, except contact from which money can be made.

> As Paul Eluard puts it in “La suppression de I'ésclavage": “The supremacy of Europe is based only on militarism and the cross—the cross in the service of militarism. ... The white man is nothing but a corpse—a corpse who dumps his garbage under the natives’ noses."

***

> “First of all we shall ruin this civilization ... in which you [bourgeois students] are molded like fossils in shale. Western world, you are condemned to death. We are the defeatists of Europe, so take care—or, rather, laugh at us. We shall make a pact with all your enemies.”

***

> David Gascoyne, the sixteen-year-old cofounder of the Surrealist Group in England in 1936: “It is the avowed aim of the surrealist movement to reduce and finally to dispose altogether of the flagrant contradictions that exist between dream and waking life, the ‘unreal’ and the ‘real’ the unconscious and the conscious, and thus to make what has hitherto been regarded as the special domain of poets, the acknowledged common property of all."

***

> A later surrealist concept — miserabilism— is also crucial, for it gives a name to the ruling ideologies of our own time, as epitomized in the New World Order, the World Trade Organization, and all the McMiseries of globalization.

***

> Victor Hugo was another influence

***

> Rimbaud's defiant dissociation from the authoritarianism and hypocrisy of white society —as evidenced by his bold cry, “Je suis négre!” (I am a Negro!) —made a deep impression on the nascent surrealist group, as it would a few years later on Aimé Césaire and his comrades from Martinique, Guyana, and Senegal.

***

> André Breton and his comrades inherited and expanded the revolutionary Romantic disdain for Progress, Modernity, and the ecocidal technological devastation that smugly persists in calling itself “development.” Surrealists have always been unrelenting critics of late capitalism, its mind-numbing consumer culture, and its systematized misery, exemplified by the military, prison, and advertising industries as well as the billionaires’ meretricious media.

Moving inspiring words.

The audio book of W. E. B. DuBois' <u>Black Reconstruction in America</u> is over thirty hours long. This phone is too old for the Audible app. Can listen in the browser. In the car we have a casette adaptor plugged into a phone adapter plugged into the phone. The sound comes out of the left car door only. Works. Driving three hours a day for the final four of eight weeks of hyperbaric oxygen therapy with Tom and LuAnn Zant in Fort Walton who gave us a bunch of deer meat. So sweet. He loves to hunt. The colder the better. Early mornings watching the woods wake up.

Jose has a tablet installed in his older car, screwed into the dashboard somehow. He can do same for us. Might make sense.

Rivka's hair lifted into a loose curly bun with the single lock curling down in front of the right ear and three inches down their bare right shoulder. Fuzzy tan lines between neck and shoulders from tank tops in the sun. Bare everything as always all summer. Too hot for otherwise. It's too late to be awake.
