Rikki is at gymnastics with the girls. Rinah does 8 hours a week. "I'm on a team, and I can do a back walkover by myself." Ashirah can do a backbend from standing without help.

Some friends recently divorced after a thirty-five year marriage. Damn, folks. What now, and what was the point of the last fifteen, the last thirty? Are we just too tired to find another path?

What planet are these people from? What planet am I from? Are we the same species? Philosophy descends like a fog. Zombie walk from ride to ride, game to game, guided by Ashirah. Leaking five dollar bills. We eat dry french fries and bagged cotton candy. I skip the cotton candy. Once you've had crack...
