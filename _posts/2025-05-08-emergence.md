A warm cocao tasted enjoyable this morning for the entire cup!

Final RAD and CIS (radiation and Cisplatin) were a week ago.

In the above line when reading aloud, the parentheticals after the period please.

Fucking dreadful. If you are facing this. So so sorry. Deep dip into affliction. Self-poisoning. Dr. Viglione, again, hinted that the COVID vaccine could have caused the cancer: something about mutated spike proteins which remain in the system. INFLAMATION. Cancer is an inflamitory disease.

- Ears: ringing
- Mouth: sores and interminable bad taste, dry
- Skin: falling apart
- Digestion: fuck you doin'a me? and fuck you back!
- Energy: where please?
- Balance: dizzy after every rising.

Climbing out though. One sharp rock at a time. Ridge up there. Light around the bend; in the distance.

You wake up mouth a desert and choke on the open wound in your throat nearly wretching or perhaps you do vomit. Get up, quickly sitting back down or putting hands on knees for balance and totter to the bathroom leaning against the walls. Drink some water or maybe put some coconut oil in the mouth or gargle the salt water. Piss. Totter back to bed. 

You wake up and beg yourself to arise. Hands and knees for a few minimal stretches. Can't just stay in bed all day? Need to get to radiation and/or perhaps get more blood taken. Needles. They can barely find one and need to stick you a few times.

Maybe you can't sleep 'cause the steroid that prevents you from feeling the poison. Toss and turn for a few hours.

But it seems to be over again or at least in the final throws. Forty days now of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Dr. Viglione recommends a supplement from brown seaweed: the marine acid polysaccharide, fucoidan. There's a photocopied medical review here to read through. 

Ask Peter Shark about it. The authors of this paper have names like Wang, Xing, Qi, Ji, Hao and Shuliang. Shandong University in Jinan China. Apparently brown seaweeds containing fucoidin have become part of some Asian diets. Anittumor, antioxidant, anticoagulant, antirombotic, immunoregulatory, antiviral and anti-inflammatory.

Immunoregulatory.

Immunoregulatory x 5 (say it five times).

Food, when will you taste good again? Soon please and thank you deity for this lesson. More wisdom. 

Good night now.
