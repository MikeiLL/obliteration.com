A true master does not create desciples, but masters.
This is based on a story told by the Sufi mystic, Rumi, as told to me by the poet [Pablo Rosenblueth](http://www.s-sense.com).
* A seeker knocks on gods door.
* God says 'who is it?'
* Me
* Go AWAY!


The seeker sulks for a while and studies the universe for some years, then returns to gods door.
* Knock Knock
* Who is it?
* Me.
* GO AWAY


The seeker is very dispondent, and spends years in solitude. Finally he has a revalation. He has seen many things, and seen people born and die, grow and fall in and out of love. After a long journey he comes again to the door of god.
* Knock Knock 
* Who is it?
* It's You


He is invited in.
