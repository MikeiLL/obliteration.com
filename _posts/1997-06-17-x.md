Mike's B.S.





**ILLNESS MOTHAF\*CKA WHAT?!!!!


 How come all the shallow cock-sucking (not even) band get the airplay?.
I'll tell ya why; they don't call it commercial for nothing. It could be Coke, Nike, McDonalds, or Sony, it's all the same shit.
That's why you gotta love cats like Frank Zappa, and what's his name from Dead Kennedy's. . .
Shit, what the fuck is this guy's name? He's got the song that goes;





 Is My Cock Big Enough?

 Is Mt Brain Small Enough?

 For you To Make Me A Star.**

 Illness is recording tonight.


 Don't 4-get: **see [NYQILL](shows.htm)**
Love, Mike ILL
