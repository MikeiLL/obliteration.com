Must renew our food stamps. Not proud and aiming away from shame, but still in it's vicinity. Expensive diet wins over self-reliance. A couple of whiskey, vodka, rum-free nights have been refreshing. Food stamps? With the grocery products that qualify, it's a wonder they don't offer drug-stamps. Or maybe that's what medicaid is.

So yo!

It's amazing how ignorant otherwise intelligent people can fucking be. "I think that Jews are more important than other people", says bro-in-law the cop. "Yes. I am more important than you because I'm Jewish." The 1200 mile from home visit almost ended there, but we're tolerant of racists.

Can't you see that a world in which every group thinks they're more important than the rest won't work? Yes, we often <em>act</em> like we're more important, but can't we agree that it's out of ignorance?
<p style="text-align: center;">"So if it was between me and a complete stranger who happened to be Jewish, you'd pick them?"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"I don't like 'what if's'."</p>
But Rivka was <em>pissed</em> her husband is seen as lesser. More that it was openly professed; she insists most of her family feel that way anyway. What year are we in, people?

Is it just Jews and everyone else or is there a hierarchy? Arabs, blacks, hispanics, asians, indians, chinese, whites, Jews. And the other nationalists, what, they're confused? Saddest part is there are people who actually believe another race is more important than they are. According to who? A fucking author who is a member of the damn "superior" race, asshole.

To even believe that human beings are superior to other life forms is based solely on the perspective of humans. How ignorant can we be?
