Did not fucking know that. Learned from Reverend Theresa at UU today, in her Lawng Eye-lyn accent that in eighteen sisty one (or so) in South Carolina (Charleston) a bunch of black people exhumed the bodies of a couple of hundred dead union soldiers from a mass grave where there had been a POW camp and spent two weeks giving them proper burials.

They then had a parade of 10,000 black folks, lead by like two thousand children (some say as high as five) to celebrate their freedom and honor the dead soldiers. Decoration day was the initial name, referring to the decoration of the graves.

End of May was chosen as the annual celebration date becuase by that time flowers bloom all over the country.
