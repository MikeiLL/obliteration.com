Coming out the side of his fucking neck the frustration.

Tired of wearing this left-cocked turban of pain or is it mere discomfort?

Fatigue pops up or drapes over. Kilmer depression.

Great Grand Aline Murray Kilmer wrote this beautiful sentiment:

> Go from me, O mine enemy,
> Before, in shame of victory,
> You find me kneeling at your feet.

Simone Weil writes of the purifying effects of suffering. Of grace.

THC and I see your fragility, my arrogance, our selfishness. Grace is or ties in with what it is to love myself still.

But laziness prevents further delving into that concept. Or is it pain? Done with Oxys. Apparently cancer cells eat them and grow though there's some dubiousness at least here. So Tylenol it is.

Purification through suffering.

Bradley Vinson got a haircut and visited for a while which was as always a calming balm of company and mutual inquisitiveness. Rinah and Ashirah eventually drawn out of their lairs to participate. Ash shares of an apparent Deportation ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) posted on a government website: sounds of chains and steel doors closing or something. Sick. We ponder the collapse of the Empire and if perhaps we are in it.

Jose next door told me today: "tu español es perfecto" or perhaps, "estas hablando el español perfecto." Obviously that is not true but the compliment was much appreciated. He also said he really appreciated that Rivka and the kids always wave–are respectful–which indicates that they are used to being disrespected.

These two watches the green and the silver worn left an right inner wrists provide a fantastic sync-shifting ASMR. Hadn't even realized that would be a thing.

Flawed flawed flawed. Good night and day.
