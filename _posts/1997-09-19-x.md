Dear diary,
 When people cook food, I burn.
 Bad Brains, bad brains, bad brains, bad brains, [bad brains](http://www.club.net/cbe//IHCRB/RESEARCH/IHCRB_Sample.html)
 The other night this singer Greg Gerring(Sp?) at Arlenes grocery on Stanton St. NYC; industry hoe-down. Rick Rubin was in effect. He's such a bad motherfucker.
This guy produced [LL Cool J](http://www.euronet.nl/users/schalk/lyrics/lyricshithimhigh.html),
[Run DMC](http://crydee.sai.msu.su/public/lyrics/cs-uwp/r/run.dmc/king_of_rock),
[Beastie Boys](http://www.auburn.edu/~wilsoa4/beastie.html),
[Chili Peppers](http://www.pathfinder.com/altculture/aentries/r/redxhotxch.html),
[Ghetto Boys](http://pathfinder.com/altculture/aentries/g/getoxboys.html),
[Jonny Cash](http://www.ba-karlsruhe.de/olu/humor/usavsfrg.html),
was tightly involved in the forming of
