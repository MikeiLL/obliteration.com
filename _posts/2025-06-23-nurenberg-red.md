Playing around more with color names and with Rosuav's help and put this [tool](/color-names) together. Or started to.

One of the colors is Nuremberg Red which we think references this [celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1561_celestial_phenomenon_over_Nuremberg) from the mid-1500's.

Listened to a beautiful interview with Audre Lorde on YouTube today en route home from HBOT (with Kropotkin's [The Conquest of Bread](https://librivox.org/conquest-bread-2-by-peter-kropotkin) on LibreVox read by various volunteers with a group called AudibleAnarchist), recorded after she'd written the Cancer Diaries. Also hung with a beautiful Patti Smith interview.
