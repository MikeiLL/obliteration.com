This place is best described as a Pizza and Coors warehouse. Quite the place for a first jaunt into professional stand-up. In all likelyhood the twelve flat screen TVs will be on through the sets. The top ten hit music that is blasting seems to be completely unnoticed by the patrons. The promoter seems nice, if a little pretentious, and his friends are sweet as pie. Apparently the manager is making them play this music. Music that licks the asshole of the basest aspects of our culture, which substitutes a celebity murder for orgasm. The music reeks of the the artists' excuses for making it.

Went really well at first. Lots of laughs. So that's why comedians so often yell. A stand-up tragic.
