Peter Kropotkin wrote in <u>Conquest of Bread</u> that there is no good reason why people should own housing they don't need while others are unhoused pointing out that the owners generally are not the people who built the houses in the first place and that generally the builders of buildings don't earn enough to be their owners.

Kwame Ture who was previously known as Stokely Carmichael who infamously commented in 1964 that <q>the only position for women in the movement is "prone"</q> continued the idea considering the ownership of all of the coal in the country being owned by a handful of people who did not dig it up.

Johanna Gosse mentions Ture's "emblematic" _joke?_ in an [article](https://flexner.blogs.brynmawr.edu/2011/10/27/the-only-place-for-women-in-the-movement-is-%E2%80%98prone%E2%80%99-2/) which includes a transcription of Judith Butler's address at Occupy Wall Street.

As usual Who owns the word?

Who owns the concentration camps? Not we the people? Alligator Alley "criminal alien" detention center.

A land without a people (lies again) for a prison without a land.

USA Israel is your doppleganger your protege your echo your shadow.

It is time. Past time.

Get rid of it.
