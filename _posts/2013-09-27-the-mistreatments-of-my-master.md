<p style="text-align: right;">by A. Dick</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First of all the motherfucker almost never exfoliates me. He'll actually find huge blackheads on my underside on the rare occasions when he chooses to explore.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They cut my glans proctor off. Removed almost the whole thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He used to beat me 'till it hurt 'cause he thought cumming was imperative.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He's very impatient with how long he allows me to feel good and full at a stretch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fucker somehow (yea, somehow) got me a case of warts at one point &amp; at regular intervals had a doctor burn them off with liquid nitrogen. Then he'd drown me in vinegar to check for more warts &amp; eventually - either out of cheapness or laziness - took to cutting the warts off with a razor (used of course) &amp; burning the open wounds with a flaming match head.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How <em>hasn't</em> he hurt and neglected me? To say nothing of the foul mouths of street walkers the freak wouldn't even dream of opening his home to, let alone kissing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TLC &amp; encouragement and a whole motherlovin' bunch of it are in high order down here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A plethera of attention. Quality time. Deep breath energy; spiritual, sensual and emotional. Morning energy. And not that mental shit either. Fuck you up there, Mind. Incessantly demanding his attention with your macho fantasies, ego trips and insecure misgivings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Me and you, Boss. We can experience some powerful states of profound joy, but there's gotta be some give and take. Some push and pull.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gimme and inch - I promise not to take a mile.</p>
