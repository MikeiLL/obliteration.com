First time we met was at an audition for the McDonalds Jazz Band when we were like, fifteen.
Neither of us got in (thank goddess). A few years later we
hooked up in Boston when his friend James got some acid from Zef and me. Last night Mark's band
[Babaloo](http://www.punkmambo.com) played in Manhattan. Fuckin' Amazing.
 **Punk Mambo** they call it. Babaloo is a Santera diety, represented by the Western saint San Lazaro,
a cripled leper. Mark says they didn't know that when they named the band. Babaloo is the best punk band, and
the rawest latin band I know.
 Woke up this morning to the sound of teeth moving in my mouth ... don't ask. Wonder how Jesus felt
after three days dead. Bet there wasn't a coffee maker in the tomb.

 Happy Easter, Mike iLL
