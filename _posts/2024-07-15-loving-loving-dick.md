Being asleep must be nice.

Thank you, Chris Kraus. <u>I Love Dick</u> has been a good companion since we met recently. You seem to with each page further illuminate the desperate despondency that is the feminine experience; the feminine perspective. It helps clarify Rivka's expressions of frustration. Feelings of invisibility.

With all this unrequested but greedily gobbled while male privilege these words are typed with tentative non-authority.

Rikki comes up with ideas and shares. I create products out of them. Both of our names go on them, but usually it is only the male name. The man is the creator, gratefully thanking the feminine counterpart. He gets added to HIS story with her as a sidebar if she's lucky.

The entire structure is so patriarchal we can barely see our way out of it. The feminine explores space is gentle and empathetic. The masculine space is competitive and callous. The feminine is introspective, present and ephemeral. Masculine is rigid and aims toward permanence.

She discovers a new way of being. He sticks his flag in it. She administrates. He owns. She cultivates. He harvests.

Intellectual property. Copyrights. Corporations. Hierarchy. Masculine devices serving masculine tendencies.

These slowly aging fingers eek out this non-product this invisible processing in thanks for additional medicine, Chris, knowing the chance of your reading it is infinitessimal. Not even caring if that word is spelled correctly. Correct spelling is probably feminine because not caring is what men do when running ahead to the next achievement.

I've got the lowest hanging balls Michele Morgan had ever seen. Feeling army green.
