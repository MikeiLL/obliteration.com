Kathy Acker and her jealous gold tooth. Catholic guilt still here chiming in on the value of her writing.

Horror of Abjection: An Essay on Abjection by french feminist Julia Kristeva was, she says in a 1986 interview at the ICA, "is... a majah wo'k fa' me".

> When I am beset by abjection, the twisted braid of affects
and thoughts I call by such a name does not have, properly
speaking, a definable object. –<cite>Kristeva</cite>

Stein's How to Write is three hundred pages without a comma. The word recondite was unfamiliar or vaguely familiar but unknown. It means abtruse which evoked triangles but that's obtuse, which means bigger than ninety degrees. Recondite and abstruse mean hard to understand. Esoteric.

Acker and [Terrence Sellers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Sellers) were apparently friends and Acker also made some loot for a while in the pleasure industry. Her writing make lives better, no? Does our life need to be justified by our service and if so, can our creative endeavors count as service.

It is pretty well established and documented that approaching our occupation as service is the most effective approach. But that is as long as and this is important the approach to the service isn't to validate our existence or justify our endeavors.

Like Audre Lorde, Kathy Acker died not long past a half century, frustrated with alopathic cancer treatments and working with alternatives.

This writing might be cancerous.
