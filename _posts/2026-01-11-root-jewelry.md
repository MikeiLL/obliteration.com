This text is written in poppy red, hexidecimal `#DC343B`. Background is gold, hex `#FFD700`.

The fat priestess pierces my genitals again and hangs from them a decoration in red and gold, colors associated with the muladara the root chakra (that's a hard ch, it doesn't sound like sha - kra). It dangles to nearly the knees and features what appears similar to a cylindrical tibetan paper lantern the size of a small coffee cup with a few similarly fabricated horizontal discs distributed above and below and a bell shape at the bottom.

Good dream. Morning dream. Thanks, mind.
