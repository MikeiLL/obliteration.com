| Breast implants for the soul. Girl wants to get one implant 'cause they're different sizes? And who says they're s'posed to match?

 Breast Implants, Los Angeles. Breast Implants, New York. More tits than a herd of pregnant cows. Breast implants like a bad, old, wrinkled porn star. Breast implants, Los Angeles in the most important time of your life. Breast implants for self love.

 Breast implants for better sex. Enlarge your sense of self. Enlarge your ego. Ever dribble when you wish you'd shot?

 Bigger. Bigger. Bigger and juicier. The bigger the better. Bigger and firmer. Breast implants, Los Angeles. Juicy jelly roll. Jelly to your jam.

 Look better. Get the desirable boys between your thighs. Come to LA and get tits. Fake trees, fake smiles, fake orgasms.

 Fake but honest. Breast implants, Los Angeles.

 Jello of the bosom.

 Shake it, baby. Shake it. Implants. Silicone. Make it strawberry.

Help me love me.
