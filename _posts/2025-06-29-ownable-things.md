> Old English is seventy percent verbs. Colonial English&mdash;which is the one we've inherited&mdash;is mostly nouns <cite>Lewis R. Gordon</cite>

He's speaking in the above quote video with Hortense J Spillers describing the difference between languages that describe the human being as a process versus a thing. An ownable thing.

There won't be a color each entry. Today has one, though:

<div style="background: #242124; display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; width: 80%; max-width: 750px; padding: 4em; color: #dd9"><code>#242124</code> makes raisin black apparently.</div>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; width: 80%; max-width: 750px; padding: 4em; color: #242124; border:1px dotted #242124;margin: 0.5em 0;">This sentence is raisin black. <br>It has an ISCC-NBS descriptor: black.</div>

So you can see by the low counts of all of those hex numbers, between twenty-one and twenty-four that there's not a lot of light ('cause those numbers translate to around forty decimal out of 255) so it's a very dark color (colour) and of the three R, G and B, R and B get equal amounts (`24`) and Green a few lower. So it's a little more than black and leaning into the (red plus blue equals) purple spectrum.

Is my room a mess?<br>Daddy, I confess<br>I am a princess

With a pineal gland full of `Apurinã Verde` ponder the fantasy of living in a society in which sensual and even sexual relations between young and old are not unhlealthy are not predatory in nature does that make you a &ldquo;dirty old&ldquo; something.

And well we are so far from that society that it takes an act of goddess to even imagine.

The song from <u>Joys of Armaggedon</u>, Box of Heartache: when and how exactly did that fall out in a plop? Thank you universe.

Sit no dance in the internal relationship with that second chakra: Svadhisthana houses the creative and sexual energies. Ośun the oriśa of prosperity, love, sensuality. The inner virgin or rather &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; which might be in the narative role of [actant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actant).
