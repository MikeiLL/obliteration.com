> Old English is seventy percent verbs. Colonial English&mdash;which is the one we've inherited&mdash;is mostly nouns <cite>Lewis R. Gordon</cite>

He's speaking in the above quote video with Hortense J Spillers describing the difference between languages that describe the human being as a process versus a thing. An ownable thing.

There won't be a color each entry. Today has one, though:

<div style="background: #242124; display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: center; width: 80%; max-width: 800px; padding: 4em; color: #dd9"><code>#242124</code> makes raisin black apparently.</div>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; width: 80%; max-width: 800px; padding: 4em; color: #242124; border:1px dotted #242124;margin: 0.5em 0;">This sentence is raisin black. It has an ISCC-NBS descriptor: black.</div>

So you can see by the low counts of all of those hex numbers, between twenty-one and twenty-four that there's not a lot of light ('cause those numbers translate to around forty) so it's a very dark color (colour) and of the three R, G and B, R and B get equal amounts ('24') and Green a few lower. So it's a little more than black and leaning into the (red plus blue equals) purple spectrum.
