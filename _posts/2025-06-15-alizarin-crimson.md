Lidia Yuknavitch mentions Alizarin crimson twice in <u>The Small Backs of Children</u> combined with bruise blue.

> Alizarin is a deep red color with a blue undertone, named after the organic dye alizarin from the madder plant. A dye is a colored substance that chemically bonds to the material to which it is being applied. This distinguishes dyes from pigments which do not chemically bind to the material they color. It's also known by the names 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone, Mordant Red 11, C.I. 58000 and Turkey Red where CI stands for color index international. Whats that? First printed in 1924, it is a reference database jointly maintained by SDC Enterprises and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Coloristscurrently containing over 27,000 individual products listed under 13,000 Colour Index Generic Names.

More on Alizarin crimson.

Our friend hexidecimal: `#E32636`. It's the background of this screen.

#### Dig this:

* ISCC–NBS descriptor: Vivid reddish orange

#### What?!?!

The ISCC–NBS System of Color Designation is a system for naming colors based on a set of 13 basic *color terms* and a small set of adjective modifiers. It was first established in the 1930s by a joint effort of the Inter-Society Color Council (ISCC), made up of delegates from various American trade organizations, and the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), a US government agency.

#### Fuck! Color term:

* A word or phrase that refers to a specific color. The color term may refer to human perception of that color (which is affected by visual context) which is usually defined according to the Munsell color system, or to an underlying physical property (such as a specific wavelength on the spectrum of visible light). There are also numerical systems of color specification, referred to as color spaces.

In other news Israel continues its stubborn existence as a neo-colonial extension racist of Western Empire and is now exchanging bombs and missiles with Iran.

And a so-called security consultant dressed as a cop assassinated one democratic representative and her husband, attempting to also assassinate another in Minnesota this week.

The assassin is still at large and we wonder if the cops on scene were trying _all that hard_ to apprehend him.
