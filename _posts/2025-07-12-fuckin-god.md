Darkness and darkness and darkness and darkness and<br>
Peace and quiet and nothing and nothing and<br>
nothing and nothing and nothing.

And then a voice: Let there be light.

And it's been a shit show ever since.

Violence and neon and hate. Kudzu, air potatoes and colonial languages that thingify everything.

What are lubricities you might wonder. Lubricious describes something lubricated perhaps in a sexually hungry way.

A way with words that fucker:

There is a style of type called <span style='font-family: "Double Struck"'>Double Struck also known as Chalkboard Bold</span>.

Say it louder:

<h2 style='font-family: "Double Struck"'>Double Struck also known as Chalkboard Bold</h2>

It is used in math.

Permutations are produced by the arrangement of items with order being maintained. What we refer to as a combination lock is in fact a permutation lock. So `AB97` and `BA86` might be different permutations while `96BA` combines the first set of characters differently.

When there was light it was supposedly good which meant that there is now also bad because otherwise good has no meaning. And there is love, longing, hunger, desire and loneliness.
