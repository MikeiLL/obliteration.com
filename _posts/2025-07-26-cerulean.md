And today we have cerulean. Under the traditional definition, a quaternary color is the even mixture of two tertiary colors. "Cerulean blue" is the name of a blue-green pigment consisting of cobalt stannate.

Cobalt stannate pigment was first synthesized in 1789 by the Swiss chemist Albrecht HÃ¶pfner by heating roasted cobalt and tin oxides together.

Cerulean blue was only available as a watercolor in the 1860s and was not widely adopted until the 1870s when it was used in oil paint. It was popular with artists including Claude Monet, Paul Signac, and Picasso. Van Gogh created his own approximation of cerulean blue using a mixture of cobalt blue, cadmium yellow, and white.
