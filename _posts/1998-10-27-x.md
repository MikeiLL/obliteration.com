| The most conservative New York we've known.
People are spending 24 to 40 hours in jail for running red lights on bicycles and not carrying proper identification. Then it takes two days of red tape hell to get your bike back. Someone nicknamed the mayor Adolf Jailiani. I myself spent a night in jail for putting a flyer on a telephone pole.

42nd street has been taken over by the Disney corperation.

Elsewhere on earth, dozens have been killed by mobs in Java for practicing witchcraft.

This is not fiction. If i had my way, pornographic movies could be rated G as long as the actors wore clown noses.
