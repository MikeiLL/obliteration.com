| Pink eye, blue ball, yellow bellied, scarlet fever,
black head lookin' sucker.

Nice comeback - she say's after I got over a bout of impotence.
"It turns me on when you cum."


Sixteen deaths related to the new "potency" drug called Viagra. They say it's
not a hazardous drug, but that these old men are kicking it right after or during sex due to over-exertion and heart failure.
What a fuckin' world.

Squirt wants to how many times in a night I can cum all over her... especially the face.
I say 2 if I'm lucky. Three is definitely a goal. [**Bootsy**](http://www.duke.edu/~tmc/pfunk.html) says the 2nd comming is the one that matters. My Catholic father says "Come again? .
. impossible."
