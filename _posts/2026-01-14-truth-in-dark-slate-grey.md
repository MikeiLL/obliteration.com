This background referenced by hex code two eff four eff four eff `#2F4F4F` is a chromatic grey because as opposed to achromatic grey as these describes the text in the color silver hex `#C0C0C0` because of the slight imbalance in quantities of red green and blue.

James fucking Baldwin at thirty years old described "sentimentality" as "the mark of dishonesty" in the Notes of a Native Son book which also shares beautifully:

>  Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which [s]he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of [s]his talent&mdash;which attitude certainly has a great deal to support it. On the other hand, it is only because the world looks on [s]his talent with such a frightening indifference that the artist is compelled to make [s]his talent important.

And a few paragraphs later in Autobiographical Notes:

> One writes out of one thing only&mdash;one's own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.

Fuck him.
