In the womb.

The sound at the beginning of the universe.

A polyrithm of two hearts.

The big slow heart of the mother and the little fast one that grows and slows.

Intermittent gurgling.

Faint voices.

Muted piano.

Will the next home compare to this one as this one does to that?

If so... kcuF!

Keep singin', right?
