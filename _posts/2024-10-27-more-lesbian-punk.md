Apparently Sisi who's name is pronounced see-see started her store at the T&W Flea Market when she was fourteen. This according to her mom, Harley who grew up an hour south of Nashville and knows how to midwife pigs and raise chickens and is named for her dad's motorcycle.

They kept expanding their booth at T&W and now have a freestanding pink block building called Sisi's Store Sucks.

They sell new and second hand hipster clothing, witchcraft books and supplies, a few sex toys, piercings. Mom does tattoos. All very LGBTQ-oriented.

We set up Rinah and Ashirah's craft booth there yesterday and sold their jewelry, crafts and paintings along with a bunch of other mostly goth punk femme creators as part of a Punk or Treat event a vibrant young woman named Alyssa was running with unceasing generosity and enthusiasm.

On the bill along with bands was Mike Kimberl "talking shit" which he did around the local criminalizing of people experiencing homelessness. His band, Pauper's Grave was one of the bands. Mike's a local and personal hero who's probably written about here already. Fed folks out of his pocket for years. Now has a career based on it. Has kept local Food Not Bombs going for a lifetime.

Halloween vibe. Sisi was an evil clown with nothing but a tiny pear of underwear shorts and carters covering her twelve feet of leg and not much more on top. All white and pink.

It was and is a powerful scene.

Felt honored to be there with the family and ideated over the idea that somewhere was a parallel life where a Christian guy was feeling blessed in his anti-abortion, anti-gay, saved community.

Giggle Out Loud record is finally finished and now for the chores of "releasing" it, which will involve Bandcamp. Trying to recall the name of the digital distribution platform we are connected with and through whom it will go out to the more rapey platforms.

Lovingly.
