Looks like, according to James Neeley's book, Breath, mouth breathing can make you piss more:

> During the deepest, most restful stages of sleep, the pituitary gland, a pea-size ball at the base of the brain, secretes hormones that control the release of adrenaline, endorphins, growth hormone, and other substances, including vasopressin, which communicates with cells to store more water. This is how animals can sleep through the night without feeling thirsty or needing to relieve themselves.
> But if the body has inadequate time in deep sleep, as it does when it experiences chronic sleep apnea, vasopressin won’t be secreted normally. The kidneys will release water, which triggers the need to urinate and signals to our brains that we should consume more liquid. We get thirsty, and we need to pee more. A lack of vasopressin explains not only my own irritable bladder but the constant, seemingly unquenchable thirst I have every night.

More reason to fuck with mouth-taping (which Rivka thinks is insane) and maybe those wild pieces of tape that pull your sinuses open.

Naked morning weight back up to 135lbs. Food tastes no longer awful and even migrating from not good to somewhat enjoyable.

Rivka says that they can see the difference Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (Thanks Tom and Dr Zant and Shannon) is making. Oh and thanks to the $9k we're paying out of pocket for it and the friends and supporters who have made it (almost, so far) possible. 

Today is the last day of two out of eight weeks of it. With the commute it's about five hours a day. Lots of time for listening and watching.

Digging this academic Robin D.G. Kelley and also one of his teachers Cedric Robinson who has a book called Black Marxism. Kelley writes about sociopolitical issues and also has a biography of Thelonius Monk which looks great.

Have a great one. Breathe deeper. Piss less. 

Hugs and kisses.
