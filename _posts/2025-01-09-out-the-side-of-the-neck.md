The neck issues persist. A few weeks ago in a dream Herbie Wagner, Caroline's dad in Mobile, showed up at a dream party and made a comment about the anger-based cancer in my neck.

Following a week of antibiotics and steroids prescribed by gorgeous Dr. Hilliary White, Dr Ho suggests we hit it harder with pharmacuticals for another week, then do the CT scan.

Let the anger stream through. The sky stops nothing.
