Maybe suicide is a bet

that nothing

could be worse
<h5>than</h5>
<h3>this.</h3>
And if it is,

I need to know now. The suspense is killing me.

Never expected to seriously consider it. But there was a point where being married with children was unimaginable. Knowing that ones own death is impending and doing it ones own way, that's simply not the same thing.

Seems like - ya complain - it's at least a tiny bit regrettable. You say something mean, eventually regret it. Punch through a wall, smash your computer, beat on a friend?
<h5>Regret, regret, regret.</h5>
Cut offÂ  a body part? Fuck your nerves permanently with Merck products?
<h3>So...</h3>
<h4>Here's to reality checks and remembering even when sleep</h4>
<h4>seems like</h4>
<h5>an escape</h5>
<h6>denied</h6>
forever more
