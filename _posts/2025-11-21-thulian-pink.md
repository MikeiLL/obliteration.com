The color of this page is Thulian Pink. The name makes reference to the [land of Thule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule), which apparently

> acquired a metaphorical meaning of any distant place located beyond the "borders of the known world"

AI says the color is "often associated with elegance and tranquility" and "commonly used in interior design and branding to create a calming atmosphere."

More Thulian Pink, please.

The job hunt has been daunting, humbling, troubling, ghostly and populated with daunting echoes.

Warm weather blessings abound.
