> To me I genuinely believe in fugitivity. I do not believe in any such thing as the figure of the fugitive. <cite>–Fred Moten</cite>

Color of the day is [Phthalo blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_phthalocyanine): `#000F89` <code style="background-color: #000F89; color: white;" >which looks like this</code>. <code style="color: #000F89;">It looks like this also</code>.

At the same time the slaves in the orange jumpsuits are outside mowing the grass so perhaps the color of the day is [Cadmium Orange](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_pigments): `#ED872D` <code style="background-color: #ED872D;" >which has this color</code> and <code style="color: #ED872D;">looks like this also</code>.

There is a branch of philosophy called [value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_theory). Intrinsic vs instrumental value. Axiology rerefs to the study of values. Hortense J Spillers references it in <u>MAMA’S BABY, PAPA’S MAYBE</u> which there are PDFs of floating around. Moten suggested that along with Toni Morrison's <u>Beloved</u> it is one of the most important pieces of writing in many decades.

> Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good, desirable, or permissible, and others as bad, undesirable, or impermissible. A norm in this sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes.

But we were talking about <span style="background-color: #000F89; color: white;">Phthalo blue</span> aka <span style="background-color: #000F89; color: white;">Copper phthalocyanine</span> (CuPc) aka <span style="background-color: #000F89; color: white;">phthalocyanine blue</span>:

> A bright, crystalline, synthetic blue pigment from the group of dyes based on phthalocyanines. Its brilliant blue is frequently used in paints and dyes. It is highly valued for its superior properties such as light fastness, tinting strength, covering power and resistance to the effects of alkalis and acids. It has the appearance of a blue powder, insoluble in most solvents including water.

And do you know about [Payne's grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payne's_grey)? `#536878` <code style="background-color: #536878; color: white;" >It looks like this</code> <code style="color: #536878;">and like this</code>.

> Payne's grey was created by the watercolourist, William Payne, for whom the colour is named, in the late 18th century. Little is known about Payne's life, and the origins of the colour are equally as unknown. However, theories suggest that Payne made the colour in the attempts to find a replacement for black when he taught watercolour, since black was the traditional mixer. <cite>St. Clair, Kassia <u>The Secret Lives of Color</u></cite>

Fuck Israel. That is a feeling.

There's a book sitting on the desk by Christian Bök called <u>Eunoia</u>. A parting gift from Perry Robinson. Maestro. In it are five sections each with "poems" including only a single vowell: a, e, i, o, u. For example <q>Porno shows folks lots of sordor&hellip;</q>

Pride festival tomorrow. We plan to arise at five. The kids friend Jaden is getting dropped off at seven to spend the day there with us. Lovely cat.

Have a good one and a great one too. Be blessed. Whatever that means.
