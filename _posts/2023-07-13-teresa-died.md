<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your unforgettable azure skies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You saw me, saw rabbits, bats, birds, friends, bands, stage hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always between future and past. Moment to moment, momentous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A history of dogmatic trauma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hopped trains to punk salvation. Academic education? Make me laugh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the music. Always the music. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Music and music within music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deadly medicine to cushion the blow of callousness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the phone with a troubled friend 'till dawn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And again. And again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inspired. Inspiring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And another joke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A worse one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What's the worst joke you know?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I told him I wanted to be cremated. He made an appointment for Tuesday."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday, pushed into the furnace, middle finger extended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parliament Lights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skies closed.</p>
