This is the worst possible reading you can do dear lost and disillusioned. I see nothing for myself but only through the words of others and am dangerously deceived into sincerity. I honestly mistake sensuality for romantic emotion, vacillation for artistic temperament and idleness for philosophic calm. This mind, vulgar in its effort at refinement, sees everything a litttle larger than life size with the outlines blurred in a golden mist of sentimentality.

I lie without knowing it and when it is pointed out describe the lies as beautiful.
