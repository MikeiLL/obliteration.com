This is the wurst possible reading you can do dear Lost and Disillusioned.

I see noThing for mySelf but only through the words of others and am dangerously deceived into sincerity. I honestly mistake sensuality for romantic emotion, vacillation for artistic temperament and idleness for philosophic calm. This mind, vulgar in its effort at refinement, sees everything a litttttle lRger than Life size with the outl(eye)ines blluurredd in a golden mist of sentimentality.

I lie without knowing it and when it is pointed out Describe the Lies as Beautiful.
