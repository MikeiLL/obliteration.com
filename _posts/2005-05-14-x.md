 Health Freedom to End in August 2005???

 Something is happening in virtual secrecy that may
 have an adverse affect on all of us.

 The CODEX ALIMENTARIUS (Food Code) is setting the
 supplement standards for the countries in the WTO,
 which includes the United States. The CODEX rules are
 intended to be enforced by the WTO and to override
 individual member nation laws. The U.S. President and
 Congress agreed to this take-over when the WTO Treaty
 was signed.

 CODEX drastically restricts vitamins, minerals, herbs
 and other supplements. CODEX met secretly in November,
 2004 and finalized "Step 8 (the final stage)" to begin
 implementation in June 2005.

 Virtually nothing about it has been in the media.
 What the drug corporations have failed to do through
 Congress they may get by sneak attack through CODEX with the
 help of a silent media.

 The CODEX says, among other things:

 (1) No supplements can be sold for preventative or
 therapeutic use.

 (2} Any potency higher than RDA (minimal strength)
 is a drug requiring a prescription and must be
 produced by drug companies. Over 5000 safe items now
 in health stores will be banned, terminating health
 stores as we now
 know them.

 (3) CODEX regulations become binding internationally.

 (4) New supplements are banned unless given very
 expensive CODEX testing and approval.

 In Norway and Germany, where CODEX is now
 implemented, zinc tablets rose from $4 per bottle to
 $52, Echinacea rose from $14 to $153 and both are now
 available by prescription only. They are now called
 "drugs". Vitamin C
 above 200 mg; niacin above 32 mg; vitamin B6 above
 4 mg are all banned. In addition, amino acids
 (arginine, lysine, carnitine, etc. ); essential fatty
 acids (omegas 3, 6, 9, etc.), or other essential
 supplements such as DHEA,
 CoQlO, MSM, beta-carotene, etc, are not allowed.

 The CODEX rules are not based on any real science or
 research. They are made by a few people meeting in
 secret . In 1993 the FDA and drug corporations tried
 to put all supplements under restriction and
 prescription. But over 4 million Americans told
 Congress and the President
 to protect their freedom of choice on health
 supplements. The DSHEA Law was passed in 1994, which
 protected our freedom. But this will be over ruled by
 CODEX and the World Health Organization.

 Is this real?
 With WTO secrecy, no media attention, confusion and
 uncertainty among supplement companies and public
 officials, and support by the FDA and harmaceutical
 lobby, uncertainty prevails. It appears, based on my
 limited understanding, that the US Congress has to
 pass legislation to require CODEX implementation in
 the United States
 before this can take effect. The August implementation
 is for the European Union. But, there is legislation
 in the US House and Senate to make this the law of our
 land as well.

 What Can We do?
 First, we need to be as well informed as possible,
 especially given the secrecy in which this is being
 handled.

 The following websites offer additional information:
<http://ahha.org/codex.htm>
<http://www.alliance-natural-health.org/>
<http://www.alliance-natural-health.org/>
<http://www.glycommunity.com/iahf/>

 Second, we all need to contact our congressmen and
 senators to make sure that they are informed about
 what is happening and that we, the voters, don't want
 it.

 Oppose bills S.722 and H.R.3377. (These bills support
 the CODEX restrictions with US laws, changing the
 DSHEA law
 that we fought so hard for.)

 Express your wishes to the President, Senators and
 Representatives ASAP.

 (They got us into this!)

 How??
 You can find the contact information on your
 congressmen and representatives by going to this
 website and
 entering your zip code.
<http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home/>

 I implore you NOT to support CODEX restrictions in the US, and to please send me any information you can share on them.

 I am health-conscious 35 year old artist and feel these restrictions move away from giving individuals and communities more control and access to natural health practices and toward more chemicals, more ignorance and more corporate power.

 Thanks for your consideration. I know I speak for many people. Be well.

 Hope it's a hoax. Scary shit.

 Released [The Electro-Funk No Wave Hip-Hop Compilation](http://www.madhappy.com). [Buy it](http://www.cdbaby.com/mutinyzoo) or don't.

 Went to the mall and some indie kid explained that a scarecrow needs to shop in the women's department for pants that fit tight.

 Developed the habit of squatting to piss, which often reveals shitting or farting as well. Healthy. Build up the leg muscles too. 'Specially in these dirty club toilets.

 Think we hit an owl on the hi-way the other night, listening to Talking Heads' Remain in Light album. Bummer.](http://www.cazwell.com)

Even $.50 cents helps : )
