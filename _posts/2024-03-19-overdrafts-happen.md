Your account balance is negative.

Spending Account ending in 1559

Mike, you overdrew your Spending Account by $29.47. Keep in mind that we may not let you make purchases or withdraw money from your account if your balance is still negative on 4/1/2024 or if you overdraft your account by more than the $100.00 CoverDraft℠ limit

Foodstamps, tax refunds and gigs, oh my.
