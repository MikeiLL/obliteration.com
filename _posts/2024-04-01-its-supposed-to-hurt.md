Billy says it's been rough personal times recently. Feel you, iLLy.

Times when the depth of my shortcomings, the count of my flaws, the accounting of my transgressions, vastness of ignorance and frequency of my idiocy are most staggering are the times when truth is most accessible.

Nearly paralyzed by humility, recalling rainbows of humiliation, I grow.
