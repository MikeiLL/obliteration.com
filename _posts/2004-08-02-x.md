| The myth of the food pyramid has made "Amerika" the nutritional laughing stock of the First World.
Get and read The Tao of Health, Sex and Longevity by Daniel P. Reed. Learn about food combining.
The "war on drugs" is another falacy. One hand throws thousands in prison for victimless crimes, while the other pushes poisons, often calling it medicine.
Quick, have babies; you get older, sicker and lonlier. When'sthe last time YOU spent time with someone over 60 wasn't family?
