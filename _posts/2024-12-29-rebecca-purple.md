The text on this page is Rebecca Purple which is named as Rosuav explained recently for the daughter of Eric Meyer who was involved in the early days of coloring the web. His daughter Becca had brain cancer. She'd decided that when she was six she would change her name to Rebecca because that was a more grown-up name. She made it a few days past her sixth birthday.

We spent the afternoon at Weber's Skate World in Milton today. The kids who work there seem very happy. Most of them are on the speed skating team. It's a taxing environment for someone with my temperment though. Black walls with neon paint. Arcade games where you win three hundred tickets and redeem them for tiny pieces of landfill.

The music. Ah the music.

Aside from being triggered back into the heartbreak of failed endeavors in entertainment I ponder why it makes me unhappy. Mariah Carey; Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga; The Def-Tones; Imagine Dragons.

It's not bad music or rather it isn't bad songwriting, singing, production or playing.

What is draining is the extreme limitation of the overall palate of sounds, harmonic relationships, vocabulary. Similarly to being in a shopping mall, after an hour (or less) of being subjected to it you begin believe the myth: that no other music exists. No blues, no jazz, no classical, no Afro-Cuban, no Indian, Arabic, Mongolian. Nothing but corporate content smashed rehashed pre-produced reproduced rendered and rerendered until there's no possibility of human error left to validate the actual flesh of our incarnations.

It actually occurred to me that it should be illegal to fill a space with such a narrow band of psychic energy, quickly followed by anti-authoritarian self-recrimination. But this is our world isn't it. You get a similar narrow band on any powerful TV or radio network.

The kids don't seem to mind. Rinah was dressed up in Lolita fashion which apparently has nothing to do with Nabakov's book though the bondage-esque Catholic school girl dresses make you wonder. Ashirah wore a lavender elastic corset over what looks like an old wedding dress and adorned her thickly rouged cheeks with white freckles. Their friends Aryn and Zoe were in jeans and t-shirts.

Glad they're all still alive and not yet as cynical as all this.

With love.
