| Katherine the Terrible. New Orleans the new Venice. Wonder if it wouldn've been different if the money for developing the levies hadn't been appropriated for the Iraq war. All our poor friends. Fuck.
 Gas prices soar. Someone said it's global warming creating the atmosphere for all these hurricanes. Whether chanel tells us to try to avoid going out on hot days. America won't sign the Kyoto Treaty.

Meanwhile we play rock and roll, developing carpol tunnel (or whatever the fuck it's called) syndrome, booking our way into underground oblivion.

Coming soon: Anatomy of a Crap Performance.

Thanks for the support. Good night.

poh-pih.
