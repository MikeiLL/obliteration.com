**Dig this:
 [Genes for Sale: 
Cells from a human spleen . . . mice that are
 genetically predisposed to get cancer . . . bacteria that can digest
 oil . . . an extract from a tree native to India . . .
 There are at least two features that these all have in common: they
 are derived from living organisms, and they all have been patented as
 "human inventions." Rapid developments in biotechnology during the
 last decade have enabled corporations and scientists to alter nature's
 handiwork for commercial profit. A major strategy for private
 exploitation in this area is to obtain the patent rights to an
 organism or its component parts. As these developments affect all of
 society, we need to decide whether any corporation, institution, or
 individual should have the right to private ownership of life.](http://www.gene-watch.org/nopatents.html)** |
