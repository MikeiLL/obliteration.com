Car finally working again after weeks. Jose had to machine a band-aid for some attachment on the transmission.

Rinah got in a small wreck in the car we'd been planning to buy from Helen and as it's a twenty year old car, insurance may total it.

We may chose to ignore the suggestion (and repair money). It's just a scratch, we think. Glad she got that out of the way.

Further trips on the bus reveals more "white" people, mostly poor. A skinny little man got on the other day carrying a big re-usable shopping bag, backpack and sleeping mat. His back so bent he looked like a lowercase letter r. From three or four seats away the smell of piss was strong.

A co-worker uses the word no frequently with customers. I was thinking of challenging her to go thirty minutes without using the word no and within ten seconds she used it three times in one sentence.

Mario our elderly mexican neighbor with wide yellowing grey beard framing few dark half-ground down teeth was evicted by the remaining housemates. He moved briefly up to a place on Michigan avenue and now apparently is in the hospital not speaking and with foam coming out of his mouth.

Canelo, his dog, remains here, perhaps being cared for by Chris, Jose and the others in the corner house. There's a no trespassing sign stapled across the entrance to the house Chris, Rafael and Mario had been in and it's unclear if anyone is currently occupying it. The place smells.

The sun is out. The sky is blue.

Worked last night as a production assistant for the Pensacola Symphony Orchestra. People who play instruments well. A conductor. Most of us auxilliary people are also musicians perhaps who don't play as well.

Kevin the lead PA was on tenure track at a university in Tennessee with a masters in theater and a wall full of certificates and awards. He's currently in some low level management position at a chain restaurant, preparing to take some state food certification test with a three hundred page study guide.

We got last months mortgage in before the first. Looks like credit card minimums will be covered as well. The utility bills a month behind well that remains to be seen.

Happy new year.
