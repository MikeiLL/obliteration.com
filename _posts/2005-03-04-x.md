| Should be doing something dull and productive, but why not write an industrial hip-hop manifesto instead?
First lets [put things in perspective](http://www.escambiaso.com/jail/main1.htm).

Now back to our story. What's industrial hop-hop? Where do [Foetus](http://www.foetus.org) and Public Enemy meet? Where do Wu-Tang Clan and Throbbing Gristle meet, both philosophically and sonically speaking? [Mad haPPy](http://www.madhappy.com) describe it's music as electro-pop/hip-hop. Where do Nine Inch Nails and Nelly meet?
Could it be that industrial hip-hop is the funk of carcinogen-breathers? Dioxin funk. Dioxin Boogie. Industrial music usually has an abrasive sound; bright electro drums and hi hats. Hip-hop's usually smoother.

In many ways it's a black/white thing. Black culture spawn hip-hop, white culture spawn industrial music. Industrial Hip-Hop.

Futura 2000 spraypainting the wall of a powerplant, with a beatbox pumping Ultramagnetic MCs and [Einstuerzende Neubauten](http://www.neubauten.org) are playing along with a circular saw against an electrical fence.

Hip-hop and Industrial culture feed into and off each other like one long snake eating it's tail. No [Ministry](http://www.ministrymusic.org) without [Africa Bambaata](http://www.zulunation.com/afrika.html), No [Public Enemy](http://www.publicenemy.com/) without [Steve Albini](http://www.electrical.com). Industrial hip-hop speaks from the sludge-spouting autonamous zones of Hoboken, New Jersey, Jersey City, Chicago, Detroit, The Meadowlands. Hip-hop is street. Big jackets 'cause it's cold and that's your home.

What's [this](http://www.cyclopspress.com/trainsofwinnipegclip.html)? What's [this](http://www.dropthelime.com)?
Fiery trash can.


poh-pih.
