Seen some good artists in New York this week. 
[Greg Garing](http://www.virginiamusicflash.com/greg.htm)'s 'Alphabet City Opry' at 9C on Monday night, and
[Rick Shapiro](http://members.aol.com/folkbro/frecrs.html) at Sidewalk Cafe on Wednesday night. it's been a hard week -
people talkin' Mercury retrograde and shit, but these two artists help get me through. 
Greg has this whole punk/country thing going down there, and Rick is what they usd 2 call a 'sick' comic. he's all stickin' his toung out,
and talkin about setting up cave-exploration lights inside a woman - makes me feel human again.
 Free [Mumia Abu-Jamal](http://www.mumia.org). He's the American martyr of our day.

 5000, Mike iLL
