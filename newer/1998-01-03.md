Bravin' the musical elements
Me and my other funky stellar Gents
Vent 'till the room's spent
Who got a cent
To Spare?
I swear, n(eye)gga don't go there.
Please don't fret
Cause the ill tet set
Is the ones I wanna be like
Call me Mike.
Ill, I chill, like to give and get
A thrill.
No frills. I don't eat pills.
Ears is Ringin'
My Throat be stinging
It's the new sounds of noi$e
That we bringin'
Im in Time, not outta rhymes
Musical crimes
No Denyin'

 Flying, Mike iLL
