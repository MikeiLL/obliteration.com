|  Saw my man Gene "The Singing Plumber" last night at the 
 Elysian Cafe. Bartender wearing a worn out old Hell's Angels T-Shirt - 
 Red, with the white SS logo on it. Kinda freaked me out. Get sensitive 
 when I'm stoned. The back room in this joint is great. All tin walls and 
 ceiling with mad ornate designs, and dust hangin' over every corner.
 The music was intense. This sax player Mark Whitecage setting fires by 
 mixing his free-bop jazz stylings in with the Plumbers honkey-tonk. That's 
 some different shit. Then Gene's walking around the join with a tip jar. 
 And homeboy's gotta be at least fifty. Lot to look forward to in this 
 biz, kids. Ha ha.
 Props to my homeboy Dave C. for keepin' up on the leftie-liberal front. 
 Fuck y'all if ya can't trust yer heart.
 Two week tour down south starts a week from tomorrow. [Antifolk 
 fest](http://www.antifolk.net) was cool. Lot's of great folk and music. Lach, Joie DBG, Mouldy 
 Peaches, Pre-War Yardsale, [Ed 
 Hamell](http://www.hamellontrial.com/), Simple...
 Hooked up with [these 
 folks](http://www.cassingleusa.com) recently through Dave Human, of [Baltimore 
 Antifolk](http://www.antifolk.com) scene. Check out Cass McCombs' [Guilt 
 Ridden Man](http://www.cassingleusa.com/mp3s/index.htm) song.
 Love, peace, kisses and some toung.
Hey Jenni - we're really gonna miss you around here. |
