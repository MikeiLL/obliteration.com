| Vote Bush out. Hopefully the Bush/Chaney Empire is not so powerful that democracy is complete illusion.
Daddy is loving, passionate and brilliant. Glad he's still alive. He's learning to enjoy the beauty of the music fading out, just as he enjoyed it fading in. Death and aging.
Young homeboy doing coke with a pocket full of cash. Recollect the days of selling. Cash rich, money poor. Carrying money is a chore. The rich don't have to touch that dirty stuff.
Studying laughter. Collecting styles.
Everything is funny.
