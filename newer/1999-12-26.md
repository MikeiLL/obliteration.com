Carlos is really drunk, and tryin'a teach me how to dance merengue; its all in the lower half. He goes, "You must be a terrible fuck, you're clingy".
 I don't know about a terrible fuck, but I am clingy. My centerpiece is a gaping wound for which her touch is the salve. God, help me let go. We fuck without expectations, desires or anxiety. You can love so much it's destructive. Never as nice as it was in the womb, but we can't breath mom forever. Let's go. 

Dream i'm watching a film in which the artist Prince turns into James Brown turns into Chuck Berry. At the end of the film, Mr. Brown is in the audience and we hang out. I cling to him, he's drunk.
