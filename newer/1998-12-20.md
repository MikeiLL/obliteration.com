Tonight is the Norse festival of Mother Night, when dreams are prophetic.

The days will get longer and the nights shorter 'till mid-summer. We have warm winters these days, worldwide drout is predicted. Some say wars will be fought over drinking water.

Our president drops how many meals worth of bombs around Iraq, days before he's impeached. Interesting stuff. Wish I understood the middle-east better.
